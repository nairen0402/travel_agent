Kusatsu Onsen (草津温泉) is one of Japan's most famous [hot spring resorts](e2292.html) and is blessed with large volumes of high quality [hot spring water](e2292_water.html) said to cure every illness but lovesickness.

Well known as a hot spring resort for many centuries, Kusatsu's fame was further boasted by German doctor Erwin von Baelz, who served at the [imperial](e2135.html) court in the late 1800s and recommended Kusatsu for its water's health benefits.

Kusatsu is situated at an altitude of 1200 meters above sea level in the mountains of [Gunma Prefecture](/list/e1209.html), and offers [skiing](e7407.html) in winter and [hiking](e7406.html) during the rest of the year to be enjoyed in combination with [hot spring bathing](e2292.html). Kusatsu is also located along Japan's [Romantic Road](e7450.html).
