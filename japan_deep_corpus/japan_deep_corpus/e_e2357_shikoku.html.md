### Assessment

Due to a big price increase of the All Shikoku Pass in May 2023, it became more difficult for the pass to pay off; however, a 3-day pass will still likely pay off if visiting at least two cities on the island, as shown by the following table, which lists approximate regular one-way fares between major stations.

|  | Tokushima | Kochi | Uwajima | Matsuyama | Takamatsu |
