Myohonji (妙本寺, Myōhonji) is one of several temples of the [Nichiren sect](e2055.html) of [Japanese Buddhism](e2055.html) along the southeastern hills of [Kamakura](e2166.html). The temple was founded by Hiki Yoshimoto in [1260](e2133.html), and features a statue of Nichiren to the left of the main hall.

The temple is connected via the Gionyama [hiking trail](e3113.html) with some other nearby [temples](e2058.html) and a [shrine](e2059.html). It leads through the wooded hills of [Kamakura](e2166.html), and should be explored only with good walking shoes and during dry weather, because there are a few steep and rough passages.

Myohonji is a ten minute walk east of Kamakura Station.
