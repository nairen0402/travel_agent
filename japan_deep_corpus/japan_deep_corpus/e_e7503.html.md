The Toyama Glass Art Museum (富山市ガラス美術館, Toyama Glass Bijutsukan) in [Toyama City](e7500.html) showcases a large collection of glass art from around the world. The beautifully modern Kirari building that houses the museum was designed by world-renowned [architect](e2111_architects.html) Kuma Kengo and also contains the city's public library.

The museum offers both permanent and temporary exhibitions. The permanent exhibitions are on the fourth and sixth floors whilst the temporary exhibitions are interspersed across multiple galleries on other floors. The permanent exhibition on the fourth floor showcases contemporary glass art by international artists procured by the museum over past decades, while the sixth floor hosts the "Glass Art Garden" exhibition, which boasts a collection of installations by Dale Chihuly.
