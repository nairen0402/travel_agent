Sainokawara Park (西の河原公園, Sainokawara Kōen) covers a valley just outside of the [Kusatsu](e7400.html) town center, where several [hot spring](e2292.html) sources and a large [outdoor bath](e7402.html) are located. Walking trails around the upper part of the park lead through the nice natural landscapes.

Hot spring water can be seen bubbling to the surface here and there, collecting into hot water pools and running down the valley in warm streams before joining the central mountain stream. There is also a hot water waterfall with a free foot bath near its base.

The park's other main attraction is the [Sainokawara Rotemburo](e7402.html#sainokawara), a public bath with two large, gender-separated outdoor [hot spring](e2292.html) pools with a capacity of 100 bathers each.

Sainokawara Park is a ten minute walk from the [Yubatake](e7401.html) along a narrow road lined by numerous [ryokan](e2029.html) and shops.
