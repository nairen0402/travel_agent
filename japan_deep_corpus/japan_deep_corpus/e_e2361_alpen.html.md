### Assessment

The Alpine-Takayama-Matsumoto Area Tourist Pass pays off relatively easily for trips within its coverage area. Besides the savings, an advantage of the pass over regular tickets is that you can travel freely along the [Alpine Route](e7550.html), including backtracking. A considerable disadvantage of the pass, however, is that pass holders cannot use the reservation system for the cablecar from Tateyama along the Alpine Route, which - on busy days - can result in long waiting times or even the inability to travel along the Alpine Route.
