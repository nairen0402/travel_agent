Yokohama (横浜) is Japan's second largest city with a population of over three million. Yokohama is located less than half an hour south of [Tokyo](e2164.html) by [train](e2019.html) and is the capital of [Kanagawa Prefecture](/list/e1215.html).

Towards the end of the [Edo Period](e2128.html) (1603-1868), during which Japan maintained a policy of self-isolation, Yokohama's port was one of the first to open to foreign trade in 1859. Consequently, Yokohama quickly grew from a small fishing village into one of [Japan's major cities](/list/e1003.html). Until today, Yokohama remains popular among expats, has one of the world's largest [Chinatowns](e3201.html) and preserves some former Western residences in the [Yamate](e3203.html) district.
