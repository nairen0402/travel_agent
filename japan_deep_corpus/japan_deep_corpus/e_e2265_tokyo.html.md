Rare snow in Tokyo's Inokashira Park

In the typical year, [Tokyo](e2164.html) gets only one or two days of light snowfall, and the snow rarely remains on the ground for more than a few days, if it collects at all. Yet the city is located reasonably close to several of Japan's [popular snow destinations](e2265.html), many of which are easy enough to access in a daytrip. The best time to visit these snowy destinations is in January and February when the snow is at its deepest.

Below are some of the best places to see snow near Tokyo (see also our [nationwide list](e2265.html)):

* 

  [Niigata Prefecture](/list/e1207.html)

  [Yuzawa](e7690.html)

  75-90 minutes, 6500 yen one way by [Joetsu Shinkansen](e2018_joetsu.html)

  Reached in under 90 minutes by [Joetsu Shinkansen](e2018_joetsu.html), [Yuzawa](e7690.html) is one of the most convenient destinations with guaranteed snow for a daytrip from [Tokyo](e2164.html). The town offers good snow, [hot springs](e2292.html) and over twenty ski resorts, one of which is even connected directly to the Gala Yuzawa [shinkansen](e2018.html) station.

  About 3 hours, 2500-5000 yen one way by train and bus

  [Nikko](e3800.html) is a good place to experience a mixture of snow and culture. While in a typical year the [shrines](e2059.html) and [temples](e2058.html) around the town center do not get much snow, the [Okunikko](e3818.html) region located higher up in the mountains around [Lake Chuzenji](e3806.html) usually offers snowy landscapes and frozen waterfalls; although snow is not always guaranteed during warmer winters.

  About 3 hours, 6000 yen one way by train and bus

  [Manza Onsen](e7495.html)

  About 3 hours, 7000 yen one way by train and bus

The mountain provides Manza with the country's most sulfuric waters, and large amounts of snowfall in the winter make the town one of the best places near [Tokyo](e2164.html) to enjoy an outdoor bath in the snow.

  [Minakami Onsen](e7460.html)

One of the [best hot springs in Minakami](e7463.html) is Takaragawa Onsen, which offers some of the largest and most famous outdoor baths in the country.

  [Karuizawa](e6030.html)

  65-80 minutes, 5500 yen one way by [Hokuriku Shinkansen](e2018_nagano.html)

  [Karuizawa](e6030.html) is an upscale mountain getaway for wealthy Tokyoites. As such, the town offers excellent shopping, including one of the country's largest [outlet malls](e2451.html).

  [Chubu Region](/list/e1104.html)

  [Mount Fuji](e2172.html)

  About 2 hours, 2000 yen one way by train or bus

  Mount Fuji is covered by snow for more than half the year, but the snow is not always easily accessible. The [Fuji Five Lake](e6900.html) region at the mountain's northern base usually sees snow during winter, but it is not guaranteed. More snow falls at the [Fuji Subaru Line 5th Station](e6922.html) halfway up to mountain, but the very snow is responsible for the road there to be partially or fully closed during much of the season. Alternatively, there are two [ski resorts](e2262.html) on the mountain, [Fujiten](e6931.html) and [Yeti](e6932.html), which use man-made snow if natural one is unavailable.
