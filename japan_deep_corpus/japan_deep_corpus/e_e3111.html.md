Main Hall

Zeniarai Benten Shrine (銭洗弁天) is a popular [shrine](e2059.html) in western [Kamakura](e2166.html), which people visit to wash their money (zeniarai means "coin washing"). It is said that money washed in the shrine's spring, will double.

[Minamoto Yoritomo](e2133.html), the founder of the [Kamakura government](e2133.html), ordered the shrine's construction after a god appeared in his dream and recommended him to build the shrine in order to bring peace to the country. Because the dream occurred on the day of the snake, in the month of the snake of the year of the snake, the shrine was later also dedicated to Benten, a [Buddhist](e2055.html) goddess associated with snakes.

Zeniarai Benten Shrine is a nice surviving example of the fusion of [Buddhism](e2055.html) and [Shinto](e2056.html). Many other shrines were stripped of their Buddhist connections when the [Meiji government](e2130.html) attempted to emancipate and separate Shinto from Buddhism.

The money washing takes place here

Zeniarai Benten Shrine is located about a 25-30 minute walk northwest of Kamakura Station. There is no bus station or other famous attraction nearby. However, the shrine is located along the Daibutsu [hiking trail](e3113.html) which connects Kita-Kamakura with the [Great Buddha](e3100.html).
