The Sukodo Former School (旧崇廣堂, Kyūsūkōdō) was built during the later stages of the [Edo Period](e2128.html) (1603-1867) as an education facility for the offspring of [samurai](e2127.html) from the former Iga, Yamato and Yamashiro provinces (parts of present-day [Mie](/list/e1225.html), [Nara](/list/e1228.html) and [Kyoto](/list/e1226.html) prefectures). The school was founded in 1821 but the original building was destroyed during a big earthquake in 1854. The current building was reconstructed in the 1860s, and it served as a public library for the majority of the 20th century.

Today, the former school is maintained as a national historical site which visitors can enter and explore. The spacious school compound contains a huge tatami mat lecture hall, a kitchen, a dormitory and a couple of [gardens](e2099.html). Sukodo offers a nice representation of [Edo Period](e2128.html) architecture and interior design with its wooden foundation, elegant screens and tiled roof.
