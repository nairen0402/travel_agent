Lake Motosuko (本栖湖) is the westernmost of the [Fuji Five Lakes](e6904.html) and best known for its appearance on the reverse side of the former 1000 [yen](e2196.html) bill and the 5000 yen bill of the preceding series. The lake is difficult to access by public transportation and largely undeveloped except for a few campsites around its shores. Outdoor activities such as camping, [hiking](e2427.html), fishing, boating and other water sports can be enjoyed around the lake.

Motosuko was formed when an eruption by [Mount Fuji](e2172.html) separated a larger prehistoric lake into three smaller lakes in the 9th century. The resulting three lakes, Motosuko, [Saiko](e6907.html) and [Shojiko](e6909.html), remain connected by underground waterways, as they continue to constantly maintain the same water level of 900 meters above sea level.

The [Omni Bus Blue Line](e6905.html) provides infrequent connections between Kawaguchiko Station, Lake Shojiko and Lake Motosuko. A one way journey from Kawaguchiko Station to Lake Motosuko takes around 50 minutes. Alternatively, regular [buses](e2015.html) run every 1-2 hours between Kawaguchiko Station and Lake Motosuko. They are bound for Shin-Fuji, Shimobe Onsen or Motosuko. The one way trip takes 30-45 minutes and costs 1470 yen.
