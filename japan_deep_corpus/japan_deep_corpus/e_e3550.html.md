Kitano-cho (北野町, Kitanochō) is a city district at the foot of the [Rokko](e3557.html) mountain range where many foreign merchants and diplomats settled after the Port of Kobe was opened to foreign trade in the second half of the [19th century](e2130.html). More than a dozen of the former mansions, known as Ijinkan, remain in the area and are open to the public as museums.
