The Institute for Nature Study (附属自然教育園, Fuzoku Shizen Kyōiku-en) is a nature reserve in the heart of [Tokyo](e2164.html) near Meguro Station. The sights and sounds of the city are left behind when you enter the [park](e3034.html). It is a wild, natural and quiet world even though the grounds are located near the [Yamanote Line](e2370.html) and bordered in part by an [expressway](e2354.html).

The Institute for Nature Study is operated by the National Museum of Nature and Science which also operates the National Science Museum at [Ueno Park](e3019.html). The aim of the institute is to preserve the natural environment of Tokyo's forests and marshlands. The grounds are used for research and education, although anyone may enjoy the park's trails and natural beauty.

As with many parks and gardens throughout [Tokyo](e2164.html), the Institute for Nature Study had its beginnings as a lord's residence some 500 years ago. The grounds became an [Imperial](e2135.html) estate from 1917 and since then the natural environment has been conserved. Now it belongs to the Ministry of Education who opened it to the public.

The park can be reached in a ten minute walk from Meguro Station on the [JR Yamanote Line](e2370.html), Nanboku Subway Line ([Tokyo Metro](e2375.html)) and Mita Subway Line (Toei).
