The Fukushima Prefectural Museum (福島県立博物館, Fukushima Kenritsu Hakubutsukan) in [Aizu-Wakamatsu](e7700.html) has an extensive permanent exhibition that illustrates Japan's entire [history](e641.html), stretching from archaeological finds from the [Jomon Period](e2131.html) (300 BC) to artifacts of daily life in the [1950s](e2124.html). The building is spacious, allowing the museum to feature impressive displays.

In addition to the permanent exhibition, there is space devoted to hosting varying temporary exhibitions that pass through. The Fukushima Museum presents an interesting and informative survey of Japanese history and culture, as well as the particularities of [Fukushima Prefecture](/list/e1208.html).

Pottery from the Kofun Period

Fukushima Prefectural Museum stands just outside the outer moats of [Tsuruga Castle Park](e7703.html). The closest stop of the [Aizu Loop Bus](e7701.html) is "Tsurugajo Sannomaru" (20 minutes from Aizu-Wakamatsu Station) just outside the museum.
