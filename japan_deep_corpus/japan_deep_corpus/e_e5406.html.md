Sunport Takamatsu is the name of the redeveloped business and shopping district around JR Takamatsu Station and Takamatsu Port, not far from [Takamastu Castle](e5403.html) and the terminal station of the Kotoden Railway, Takamatsu-Chikko Station.

**Takamatsu Port** used to be the main entry point to [Shikoku](/list/e1107.html) until the island was connected to Honshu by the Seto Ohashi Bridge in 1988. Today, the port continues to offer ferry connections to several nearby islands, including [Shodoshima](e5430.html), [Naoshima](e5475.html), [Megijima](e5412.html) and [Ogijima](e5413.html).

Since the dramatic drop of car ferry traffic in 1988, the area around the port has been redeveloped with one of Japan's most pleasant waterfront promenades and a large pedestrian plaza, flanked by JR Takamatsu Station, [JR Hotel Clement](https://www.booking.com/hotel/jp/jrhoterukurementogao-song.html?aid=371183) and the Symbol Tower.

The tallest building of Sunport Takamatsu, the **Symbol Tower** is a 30 story office building with the Maritime Plaza shopping center on its lower floors and dining options on its top floors.
