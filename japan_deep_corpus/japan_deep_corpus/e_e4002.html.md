The Umeda Sky Building (梅田スカイビル) is a spectacular high rise building in the [Kita](e4009.html) district of [Osaka](e2157.html), near Osaka and Umeda stations. It is also known as the "New Umeda City".

The 173 meter tall building consists of two towers that are connected with each other by the "Floating Garden Observatory" on the 39th floor. The observatory offers great views of the city through its windows and from its open-air deck. In the basement, there is a restaurant floor that replicates a town of the early [Showa Period](e2129.html), while offices occupy most other floors.
