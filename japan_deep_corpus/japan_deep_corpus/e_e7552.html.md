With an early start and quick travel pace, the [Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route](e7550.html) can be covered in a day trip from the major cities of [Tokyo](e2164.html), [Nagoya](e2155.html), [Kyoto](e2158.html) and [Osaka](e2157.html). However, to allow for a more leisurely experience, staying overnight along or near the Alpine Route is recommended. In addition, the itinerary can be easily extended to include other popular destinations in the area. Below are some suggested itineraries:

* 

  Tokyo - full route - Tokyo

  Take the [Hokuriku Shinkansen](e2018_nagano.html) from [Tokyo](e2164.html) to [Toyama](e7500.html) and traverse the [Alpine Route](e7550.html) to Ogizawa. From Ogizawa, take a [bus](e2015.html) to [Nagano](e6000.html) and return to Tokyo by the Hokuriku Shinkansen. The entire trip is covered by the [Japan Rail Pass](e2361.html) except for the Alpine Route itself. This itinerary can also be done in the opposite direction. With an early start, it is possible as a day trip.
* 

  Tokyo - full route - Kyoto/Osaka

  Take the [Hokuriku Shinkansen](e2018_nagano.html) from [Tokyo](e2164.html) to [Nagano](e6000.html), followed by a [bus](e2015.html) ride to Ogizawa before traversing the [Alpine Route](e7550.html) to [Toyama](e7500.html). Afterwards, take the [Hokuriku Shinkansen](e2018_nagano.html) and limited express train via [Tsuruga](e6650.html) to [Kyoto](e2158.html) or [Osaka](e2157.html). The entire trip is covered by the [Japan Rail Pass](e2361.html) except for the Alpine Route itself. This itinerary can also be done in the opposite direction.
* 

  Tokyo - partial route - Tokyo (via Matsumoto)

  Access the Alpine Route from the Nagano side via [Matsumoto](e6050.html), but instead of completing the entire route, travel only to as far as [Murodo](e7553.html), turn around and return to [Tokyo](e2164.html) the same way you came. The journey is fully covered by the [Japan Rail Pass](e2361.html) and [JR East Nagano Niigata Area Pass](e2361_nagano_niigata.html) except for the Alpine Route itself.
* 

  Tokyo - partial route - Tokyo (via Toyama)

  Take the [Hokuriku Shinkansen](e2018_nagano.html) to [Toyama](e7500.html), and then instead of completing the entire route, travel only to as far as [Murodo](e7553.html), turn around and return to [Tokyo](e2164.html) the same way you came. The journey is fully covered by the [Japan Rail Pass](e2361.html) except for the Alpine Route itself. While this itinerary is somewhat less time-consuming than the above one (partial route via Matsumoto), travelers will not be able to experience what many consider the more spectacular section between [Murodo](e7553.html) and the [Kurobe Dam](e7554.html).
* 

  Kyoto/Osaka - full route - Kyoto/Osaka

  Take the [Tokaido Shinkansen](e2018_tokaido.html) to [Nagoya](e2155.html), transfer to a limited express to [Matsumoto](e6050.html) and then to the JR Oito Line to Shinano-Omachi. After completing the [Alpine Route](e7550.html), take the [Hokuriku Shinkansen](e2018_nagano.html) and limited express train via [Tsuruga](e6650.html) back to [Kyoto](e2158.html) or [Osaka](e2157.html). The entire journey is covered by the [Tateyama Kurobe Alpen Kippu](e7551.html). It is also covered by the [Japan Rail Pass](e2361.html) except for the Alpine Route itself. This itinerary can also be done in the opposite direction, but if you want to complete it in a daytrip, it is recommended to do it in the counter-clockwise direction due to a lack of early-morning connections to Tateyama.
* 

  Kyoto/Osaka - partial route - Kyoto/Osaka

  Take a [limited express](e2016.html) train from [Kyoto](e2158.html) or [Osaka](e2157.html) to [Tsuruga](e6650.html), transfer to the [Hokuriku Shinkansen](e2018_nagano.html) to [Toyama](e7500.html) and traverse the [Alpine Route](e7550.html) as far as the [Kurobe Dam](e7554.html) before backtracking the same route to Kyoto or Osaka. The entire trip, except the Alpine Route itself, is covered by the [Japan Rail Pass](e2361.html). This itinerary cannot be done in a daytrip due to a lack of early-morning connections to Toyama on most days.
* 

  Nagoya - full route - Nagoya

  Take a limited express train from [Nagoya](e2155.html) to [Matsumoto](e6050.html) and transfer to the JR Oito Line to Shinano-Omachi. After completing the [Alpine Route](e7550.html), return to Nagoya via [Kanazawa](e2167.html) (faster) or [Takayama](e5900.html) (more scenic). This itinerary can also be done in the opposite direction, but the counter-clockwise direction allows for an earlier start in the morning. The [Alpine Takayama Matsumoto Area Tourist Pass](e2361_alpen.html) is well suited for visiting the Alpine Route from Nagoya.

### Suggested additions

* 

  [Matsumoto](e6050.html)

  Located between [Tokyo](e2164.html) and the [Alpine Route](e7550.html), just one hour by [train](e2016.html) from Shinano-Omachi, [Matsumoto](e6050.html) makes a good base for a visit to the Alpine Route. [Matsumoto Castle](e6051.html), one of the best [castles](e2296.html) in Japan, adds to the reason why one should make a stopover.
* 

  [Kanazawa](e2167.html)

  [Kanazawa](e2167.html) is located along the way between Osaka and Kyoto and the Alpine Route. The city offers lots to see such as the [21st Century Museum](e4209.html), [Ninjadera Temple](e4205.html), the [Chaya Districts](e4206.html) and [Kenrokuen](e4200.html), one of Japan's finest [landscape gardens](e2099.html).
* 

  [Takayama](e5900.html)

  [Takayama](e5900.html) is widely popular among both domestic and international tourists for its beautifully preserved [old town](e5903.html). The small city offers several other attractions and a visit in combination with the [Alpine Route](e7550.html) is recommended. Hida limited express trains between [Nagoya](e2155.html) and [Toyama](e7500.html) stop at Takayama along the way.
* 

  [Shirakawago](e5950.html)

  [Shirakawago](e5950.html) is a designated [World Heritage site](e2251.html) and its traditional gassho-zukuri farmhouses draw visitors from afar. A [farmhouse stay](e5952.html) in the area is an excellent injection of culture into the journey to or from the [Alpine Route](e7550.html).
* 

  [Kurobe Gorge](e7575.html)

  The [Kurobe Gorge](e7575.html) is a beautiful, forested ravine in the rugged mountains north of the Alpine Route. Its main attraction, the Kurobe Gorge Railway, was originally built to aid the construction of the [Kurobe Dam](e7554.html) along the Alpine Route. Today, the railway no longer provides access to the dam, but sightseeing trains remain in operation as they meander through the gorge, providing lovely views of nature.
* 

  [Toyama](e7500.html)

  A major transport hub in the region, [Toyama](e7500.html) also has a share of sites of interest to offer, including a reconstructed [castle tower](e7502.html) and a modern [glass museum](e7503.html).
* 

  [Kiso Valley](e6075.html)

  The [Kiso Valley](e6075.html) runs alongside the mountains of the Central Alps, and it is home to a few former [post towns](e2422.html) along an important trade route between Kyoto and Tokyo in the past. The post towns are preserved to look as they did during the [Edo Period](e2128.html) (1603-1868), and visitors are able to enjoy the stone paths and wooden buildings of a bygone era.
