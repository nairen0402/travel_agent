Ceramic statue facing Imari Station

Imari (伊万里) is a small seaside city in western [Saga Prefecture](/list/e1241.html) on [Kyushu](/list/e1108.html). In past centuries, Imari's port was the gateway for shipping out ceramic wares from the main production centers of [Arita](e8302.html), [Okawachiyama](e8303.html) and [Karatsu](e8375.html). During the [Edo Period](e2128.html), [pottery](e2329.html) from the region was also exported overseas via [Dejima](e4408.html) in [Nagasaki](e2162.html) and became known as "Imari-yaki". These antiques are now referred to as Old Imari (Koimari) to differentiate them from modern Imari-yaki.

During the heydays of porcelain production, Imari was a thriving town filled with artisans of various disciplines, and merchant houses lined the banks of the Imari River which runs through the town center. A handful of these merchant houses were preserved or restored and are open to visitors today. There are also various shops selling ceramics, while the city center's main roads and bridges are decorated by porcelain statues.
