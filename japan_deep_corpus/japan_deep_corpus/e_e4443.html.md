Nakadori Island (中通島, Nakadōri-jima) is the second largest and second most populated of the [Goto Islands](e4440.html) after [Fukue Island](e4442.html). Like Fukue, Nakadori Island is known for its many churches, of which it has an even greater number. Apart from churches, the island boasts charming views of beautiful nature spots and villages dotted around its rugged coastline.

The entire island falls under the municipality of Shinkamigoto Town, and despite having a few developed areas, including Arikawa in the north and Narao in the south, the island feels more remote than [Fukue Island](e4442.html). Wakamatsu Island (若松島, Wakamatsu-jima) lies to the southwest of Nakadori, with the two connected by the Wakamatsu Bridge. Even less developed than Nakadori Island, Wakamatsu is the gateway to a chain of smaller islands that become increasingly isolated.

Some of the top attractions of Nakadori and Wakamatsu islands are listed below:

### How to get around Nakadori and Wakamatsu Island
