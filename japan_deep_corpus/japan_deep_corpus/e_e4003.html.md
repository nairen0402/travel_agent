[Osaka](e2157.html) has been the capital for [bunraku](e2092.html), traditional Japanese puppet theater, for many centuries. The popularity of the theater form had grown in the city during the [Edo Period](e2128.html) (1603-1868) when bunraku - like [kabuki](e2090.html) - was a rare kind of art entertainment for the common public, as opposed to entertainment for the nobility.

The National Bunraku Theater (国立文楽劇場, Kokuritsu Bunraku Gekijō) in [Osaka](e2157.html) is one of the few places to view the fascinating [art](e639.html) form today. English programs and earphones are available. Performances are usually held in three week runs in January, April, June, July/August and November.

The closest station is Nippombashi Station on the Sennichimae and Tanimachi subway lines.
