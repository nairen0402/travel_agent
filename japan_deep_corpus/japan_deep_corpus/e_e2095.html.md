A calligraphy student attempts to copy the example written by the instructor

Calligraphy (書道, shodō: "the way of writing") is the [art](e639.html) of writing beautifully. Most children in Japan learn calligraphy in elementary school, and it is also a popular hobby among adults. An interesting aspect of [Japanese writing](e621.html) that carries over to calligraphy is the importance that is placed on the order in which the strokes of characters are drawn.

There are three main styles of writing. The block (kaisho) style is the most basic form and the easiest to write, so beginners usually learn this style first. Upon mastering this style, practitioners then move up to practice the semi cursive (gyosho) style before moving on to the cursive (sosho) style. Becoming skilled at the sosho style takes a lot of practice.

There are a few places where tourists can take **calligraphy lessons** for beginners in English, including some [temples](e2058.html) and culture centers. Although available nationwide, they are more easily found in large cities, including in [Kyoto](e2158.html) and [Tokyo](e2164.html). Local tourist information desks and travel activity websites, such as [Klook](https://www.klook.com/en-US/search/result/?query=calligraphy&aid=12675), are good places to search for such [activities](e2424.html).

A typical calligraphy experience consists of learning about the craft's history before being guided through the techniques involved. Participants then get the chance to practice writing particular sets of [kanji](e2046.html) under the purview of the instructor. At the end, participants are usually able to have some of their work packed in a protective manner so as to take home with them. Lessons typically take 1-2 hours and cost between 2000 and 5000 yen per person. Advance reservations are often required.

Practicing shodo as part of an old house (kominka) experience

A calligraphy set consists of:

* **Shitajiki**: Soft mat. It provides a comfortable, soft surface for writing.
* **Bunchin**: Metal stick to weight down the paper during writing.
* **Hanshi**: Special, thin calligraphy paper.
* **Fude**: Brush. There is a larger brush for writing the main characters and a smaller one for writing the artist's name. The small brush, however, can be used for the characters, too.
* **Suzuri**: Heavy black container for the ink.
* **Sumi**: Solid black material that must be rubbed in water in the suzuri to produce the black ink which is then used for writing. Instead, "instant ink" in bottles is also available.
