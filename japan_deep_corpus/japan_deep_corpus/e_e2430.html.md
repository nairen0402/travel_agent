Haneda Airport (羽田空港, Haneda Kūkō, HND), formally known as Tokyo International Airport, is located less than 30 minutes south of central [Tokyo](e2164.html), considerably closer to the city center than [Narita Airport](e2027.html), Tokyo's other airport. Compared to Narita Airport, Haneda Airport handles significantly more [domestic flights](e2365.html), but fewer [international flights](e2034.html). It is by far Japan's busiest [airport](e2365.html) and also ranks among the world's busiest airports.

Haneda Airport was opened in 1931. In 1978, the then newly constructed Narita Airport took over most of Tokyo's international air traffic, while Haneda was designated to handle the capital's domestic air traffic. Haneda resumed handling an increased number of international flights in 2010 with the completion of a new runway and international terminal building.

Terminal 3

Today, Haneda has three terminal buildings. **Terminal 3** handles most of the airport's international flights and offers a pleasant range of dining, shopping and entertainment options. Domestic flights use the airport's two other terminals: **terminal 1**, which is mainly used by [JAL](e2365.html), and **terminal 2**, which is mainly used by [ANA](e2365.html) and also handles some international ANA flights.

Free shuttle buses operate frequently between all terminal buildings (outside of the security check). **Transit passengers** may also use the monorail or Keikyu Railway for free if they get a special transit pass at the information counter. In addition, ANA and JAL operate direct buses for checked-through passengers between the secure areas of their respective terminals.

Some [international flights](e2034.html) arrive and depart in the early morning (between 4am and 6am) and the late evening (between 10pm and 2am). Travelers with flights arriving after 10pm or departing before 7am should note that public transportation to/from central [Tokyo](e2164.html) does not run 24 hours and are advised to use a [hotel](e2025.html) at the airport. [Taxis](e2021.html) remain available, but are a relatively expensive option with fares to central Tokyo costing between around 6,000 (Shinagawa area) and 11,000 (Ikebukuro area) yen in the late evening and early morning.

#### Late night transportation

The Tokyo Monorail and Keikyu Railway stop operation around midnight. Most of the last services still provide a connection to the [JR Yamanote Line](e2370.html) at Hamamatsucho Station and [Shinagawa Station](e3040.html) respectively, from where the Yamanote Line can take you to [Tokyo](e2164.html)'s main districts, including [Shinjuku](e3011.html), [Shibuya](e3007.html), [Ikebukuro](e3038.html) and [Tokyo Station](e3037.html) by around 1am. But note that many hotels do not allow late-hour check-ins.

Airport bus companies operate some late-night connections from Haneda Airport's terminal 3 to a few places in [Tokyo](e2164.html) until around 1am, but note that they are more expensive than buses departing before midnight (typically twice the regular fare).

#### Early morning transportation
