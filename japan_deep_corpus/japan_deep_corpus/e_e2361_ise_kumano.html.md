### Assessment

The Ise-Kumano-Wakayama Area Tourist Pass is an interesting deal for travelers interested in visiting the [Kumano Region](e4950.html) from [Nagoya](e2155.html), as the cost of regular tickets for a round trip between Nagoya and Shingu by limited express trains alone (around 15,000 yen) is close to the cost of the pass (16,500 yen). The pass does not pay off for just a side trip from Nagoya to [Ise](e4301.html), as regular tickets for such a trip cost only around 5000 yen.

### Alternative tickets

When accessing the [Kumano Region](e4950.html) from [Osaka](e2157.html), the [Kansai Wide Area Pass](e2361_08.html) can be of good value. Unlike the Ise-Kumano-Wakayama Area Tourist Pass, the Kansai Wide Area Pass does not cover buses around Kumano, though.
