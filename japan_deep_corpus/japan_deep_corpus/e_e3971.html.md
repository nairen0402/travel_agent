Kyoto Aquarium (京都水族館, Kyōto Suizokukan) is modern and nicely designed, but small compared to Japan's best [aquariums](e2425.html). It was opened in 2012 in Umekoji Park, about one kilometer west of [Kyoto Station](e3922.html). The two-story facility is divided into several zones with various themes, exhibiting a variety of aquatic animals.

Unique to the aquarium is a zone that recreates the aquatic environment of rivers in [Kyoto](e2158.html) and features the Japanese giant salamander. The aquarium also strives to preserve numerous species of rare local aquatic life through breeding. In other zones, visitors can see sea life from across the world, including jellyfish, penguins and seals. There is also a dolphin stadium with multiple performances per day.

Main tank

Kyoto Aquarium is in Umekoji Park, a 15 minute walk west from [Kyoto Station](e3922.html) or a five minute walk from Umekoji-Kyotonishi Station (3 minutes, 150 yen one way from Kyoto Station).
