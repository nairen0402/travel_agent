Sapporo (札幌, "important river flowing through a plain" in [Ainu](e2244.html) language) is the capital of [Hokkaido](/list/e1101.html) and Japan's fifth largest [city](/list/e1003.html). Sapporo is also one of the nation's youngest major cities. In 1857, the city's population stood at just seven people.

In the beginning of the [Meiji Period](e2130.html) (1868-1912), when the development of Hokkaido started on a large scale, Sapporo was chosen as the island's administrative center and enlarged according to the advice of foreign specialists.

Sapporo became world-famous in 1972 when the [Olympic Winter Games](e2260.html) were held there. Today, the city is well known for its [ramen](e2042.html), [beer](e2037.html), and the annual [snow festival](e5311.html) held in February.
