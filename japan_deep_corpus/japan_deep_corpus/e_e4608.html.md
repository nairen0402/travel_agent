Kagoshima Aquarium (いおワールドかごしま水族館, Io World Kagoshima Suizokukan) is located along the waterfront, just beside the [Sakurajima](e4601.html) ferry terminal. The [aquarium](e2425.html) was opened in 1997 and has a total of seven floors. There is an emphasis on local marine life, including the chain of islands to the south that are also part of [Kagoshima Prefecture](/list/e1246.html).

The aquarium's most impressive attraction is its massive **Kuroshio Tank**, which holds fish of all sizes. There are schools of tiny fish, rays and even a giant whale shark. Other exhibition areas include sea otters, giant crabs, coral reefs, electric eels and mangroves. There is a **Dolphin Pool** that has three dolphins shows per day. Occasionally the dolphins are allowed to swim freely in the canals outside the aquarium where they also perform tricks.

The Kagoshima Aquarium is a five minute walk from the Suizokukan-guchi tram stop (170 yen) or can be reached by the [City View Bus](e4604.html) in about an hour from Kagoshima Chuo Station.
