Uji (宇治) is a small city situated between [Kyoto](e2158.html) and [Nara](e2165.html), two of Japan's most famous historical and cultural centers. Its proximity to these two former capitals resulted in Uji's early development as a cultural center in its own right. At the height of political power of the Fujiwara clan in the [Heian Period](e2132.html) (710-1185), buildings such as [Byodoin Temple](e3923.html) and [Ujigami Shrine](e3978.html), the oldest extant shrine in Japan, were contructed in Uji.

Uji is also famous for its [green tea](e2041.html). While [Kozanji Temple](e3940.html) in Kyoto is believed to be the original site of tea cultivation in Japan, Uji's [tea](e2041.html) became known for its superior quality in the 1200s.
