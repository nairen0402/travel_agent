Main Hall (Dongeden)

Jochiji (浄智寺, Jōchiji) is the number four of [Kamakura](e2166.html)'s five great Zen temples. It is a branch [temple](e2058.html) of the Engakuji school of the Rinzai sect of [Zen Buddhism](e2055.html). Its head temple, the [Engakuji Temple](e3103.html), stands just a few hundred meters away on the opposite side of the railway tracks.

Jochiji was founded in [1283](e2133.html) by members of the ruling Hojo family on the occasion of the premature death of a son. Once a large temple complex with many buildings and subtemples, Jochiji is now small and calm. In its main hall, the temple's main object of worship, a Buddhist trinity of the Amida Buddha, Shaka Buddha and Miroku Buddha, is displayed.

Behind the temple's main hall, a circular path leads through the temple garden and past a graveyard and some caves. At the temple's entrance, one of the ten celebrated wells of [Kamakura](e2166.html) can be found, but it seems to have lost some of its beauty over the centuries. Next to Jochiji starts the Daibutsu [hiking trail](e3113.html), which leads to the [Great Buddha](e3100.html) in about an hour.

Approach to Jochiji Temple

Jochiji is a ten minute walk from Kita-Kamakura Station on the JR Yokosuka Line, one station before Kamakura Station when coming from [Tokyo](e2164.html).
