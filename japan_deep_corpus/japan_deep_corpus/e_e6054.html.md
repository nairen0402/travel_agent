The Japan Ukiyo-e Museum (日本浮世絵博物館, Nihon Ukiyo-e Hakubutsukan) exhibits [ukiyo-e](e2291.html) (woodblock prints) from the vast collection of the Sakai family. One of [Matsumoto](e6050.html)'s wealthiest merchants of his time, Sakai Yoshiaki started collecting ukiyo-e and other pieces of art roughly 300 years ago. His descendants have been enlarging the collection to over 100,000 pieces, making it one of the world's largest private art collections.

Compared to the size of the collection and the museum building, the number of works exhibited in the Japan Ukiyo-e Museum is rather small, partly due to the fact that the building was originally built solely for storage rather than exhibition purposes. English descriptions for the exhibits are brief.

The Japan Ukiyo-e Museum is located about three kilometers outside of [Matsumoto](e6050.html)'s city center, close to Matsumoto Interchange of the Nagano Expressway. It can be reached in a 10 minute [taxi](e2021.html) ride from Matsumoto Station (about 2000 yen from the station's Alps Exit) or in a 15-20 minute walk from Oniwa Station on the Matsumoto Dentetsu Kamikochi Line (5 minutes, 180 yen from Matsumoto Station).
