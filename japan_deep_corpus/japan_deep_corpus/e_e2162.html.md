Nagasaki (長崎) is an important port city on the island of [Kyushu](/list/e1108.html) and the capital of [Nagasaki Prefecture](/list/e1240.html). Its rich history and culture and attractive location around a narrow inlet make Nagasaki one of Japan's most interesting travel destinations.

Thanks to its proximity to the Asian mainland, the port city of Nagasaki has played a prominent role in foreign trade relations for many centuries and was the most important of only a very few ports open to restricted numbers of foreign traders during Japan's [period of isolation](e2128.html). In more recent history, Nagasaki became the second city after [Hiroshima](e2160.html) to be destroyed by an [atomic bomb](e4400.html) towards the end of [World War II](e2129.html).
