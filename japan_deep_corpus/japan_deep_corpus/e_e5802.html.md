Some of [Matsue](e5800.html)'s former [samurai](e2127.html) mansions have been preserved along the busy road north of [Matsue Castle](e5801.html)'s inner moat.

Among the buildings is the **Matsue Bukeyashiki** (松江武家屋敷), a former samurai residence which is now open to the public as a good example of a highly ranked [samurai](e2127.html) family's mansion in a mid-sized castle town. Also in the area stands the [former residence of Lafcadio Hearn](e5803.html).

The samurai district is located just north of [Matsue Castle](e5801.html) along the moat. It is connected with Matsue's railway stations by the [Lakeline](e5805.html) loop bus.
