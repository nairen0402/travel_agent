Kyu Shiba Rikyu (旧芝離宮, Kyū Shiba Rikyū or "Former Shiba Villa") is a classic Japanese [landscape garden](e2099.html) in central [Tokyo](e2164.html), located just next to Hamamatsucho Station and not far from [Hama Rikyu](e3025.html), another popular Japanese landscape garden.

A green oasis surrounded by tall buildings, the Kyu Shiba Rikyu Garden features the typical elements of a Japanese landscape garden, including a pond and man-made hills, symbolizing the ocean, lakes and mountains of the real world, and circular walking trails to enjoy the garden from various perspectives.

During the [Edo Period](e2128.html) (1603-1868), the garden was built on land reclaimed from Tokyo Bay, and served as part of the residence of feudal lords and government officials. In 1875 after the fall of the feudal government, it was turned into the Shiba Detached Imperial Villa, however, all buildings were destroyed in the [Great Kanto Earthquake](/a/earthquake/) of 1923.

In 1924, Kyu Shiba Rikyu Garden was opened to the public.
