Outside Daikanyama Station

Daikanyama (代官山) is a trendy district in [Tokyo](e2164.html), just south of [Shibuya](e3007.html). Unlike nearby Shibuya and [Ebisu](e3028.html) which have many tall buildings, large shopping malls and high traffic, Daikanyama is comparatively quieter with a mix of residential and commercial buildings that are mostly low-rise. Street wear and fashion brands make up the majority of the local shops, while independent cafes and restaurants provide an attractive range of dining options.

The area is compact and can be comfortably covered on foot as many of the popular sites are no more than a ten minute walk from the station and each other. One of the district's main attractions is the [Daikanyama T-Site](e3007_daikanyama.html#tsite), a pleasant commercial complex comprising of a bookstore with chic designs, cafes and retail stores.

  Log Road Daikanyama

  Hours depend on the shops; typically 10:00 to 18:00
