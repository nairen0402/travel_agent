The Mishima Candle Shop (三嶋和ろうそく店, Mishima Warōsokuten) in [Furukawa](e5975.html) has been in business for more than 240 years, producing and selling traditional Japanese candles (warosoku). It is located in a traditional building in Furukawa's old town, and you can catch a glimpse of the building's interesting interior from the shop. The process of candle making is demonstrated in the store at certain times.

The candle shop was used as a set in the popular NHK morning drama "Sakura", which aired in 2002. In the drama, the heroine Sakura lived in the house on a homestay program, while she was teaching at the local school.

The candle shop can be reached in about five minutes on foot from the station.
