The Eastern Golden Hall and Five-Storied Pagoda

Construction Notice:

Kofukuji's 5-storied pagoda is undergoing extensive [renovation works](/event/construction.html) from July 2023 until March 2031, during which the pagoda is covered up.

Kofukuji (興福寺, Kōfukuji) used to be the family [temple](e2058.html) of the [Fujiwara](e2132.html), the most powerful aristocratic clan during much of the [Nara and Heian Periods](e2132.html). The temple was established in [Nara](e2165.html) at the same time as the capital in 710. At the height of Fujiwara power, the temple consisted of over 150 buildings.

The temple features several buildings of great historic value, including a five-storied pagoda and a three-storied pagoda. At 50 meters, the **five-storied pagoda** is Japan's second tallest wooden pagoda, just seven meters shorter than the five-storied pagoda at Kyoto's [Toji Temple](e3919.html). Kofukuji's pagoda is both a landmark and symbol of Nara. It was first built in 730, and was most recently rebuilt in 1426. Neither pagoda can be entered by the public.

While entrance to Kofukuji's temple grounds is free and possible around the clock, there are three areas that require paying an entrance fee: The Central Golden Hall, the Eastern Golden Hall and Kofukuji's National Treasure Museum.

Reconstructed Central Golden Hall

Kofukuji's main temple hall, the **Central Golden Hall**, was destroyed by fire roughly 300 years ago and was not rebuilt in its original size until recently. After many years of reconstruction, the hall was reopened to the public in October 2018. East of the Central Golden Hall stands the **Eastern Golden Hall** which houses a large statue of the Yakushi Buddha.

Located not far from the Eastern Golden Hall, the **National Treasure Museum** exhibits part of the [temple](e2058.html)'s great art collection and is an absolute must-see for lovers of Buddhist art. Among the many outstanding exhibits is the three-faced, six-armed Ashura Statue, one of the most celebrated Buddhist statues in all of Japan.

Another pair of interesting buildings are the Northern and Southern **Octagonal Halls**. They both originally date back over a thousand years, and their present reconstructions were completed in 1210 and 1789 respectively. They are not usually open to the public.

Kofukuji is a five minute walk from Kintetsu Nara Station, or a 20 minute walk from JR Nara Station. Kofukuji can also be reached from JR Nara Station by clockwise running loop [bus](e2015.html) or any of the buses bound for [Kasuga Taisha](e4102.html) (5-7 minutes, 250 yen). Get off at Kencho-mae.
