Fukuura Island (福浦島, Fukuurajima) is one of the few pine-covered islands in [Matsushima Bay](e5101.html) that is accessible to the public. The island is reached via a 252 meter long, red painted bridge that costs 200 yen (round trip) to cross. The bridge was damaged by the tsunami of [March 11, 2011](e5027.html) and had to undergo repair works.

There is not much to see on the island besides plants and views of the bay. The island is a natural botanical garden with a network of pleasant walking trails. It takes about one hour to walk all the trails at a leisurely pace. Some nice views of the [bay](e5101.html) can be enjoyed along the way.

Visitors can sit and admire the nice views

Fukuura Island is a 5-10 minute walk from the Matsushima Pier or a 15-20 minute walk from Matsushima-Kaigan Station.
