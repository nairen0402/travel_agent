Nanatsugama-Godan-no-Taki

The Nishizawa Keikoku (西沢渓谷) near [Kofu](e6950.html) is one of the most beautiful valleys of the Chichibu-Tama-Kai National Park, a [national park](e2325.html) which covers more than 1250 square kilometers of forested mountains, hills, gorges and some rural towns in the prefectures of [Yamanashi](/list/e1217.html), [Saitama](/list/e1213.html), [Nagano](/list/e1216.html) and [Tokyo](e2164.html).

A hiking trail leads up the narrow Nishizawa Valley along a picturesque mountain stream and past several waterfalls. After about 90 minutes, you reach the valley's highlight, the Nanatsugama-Godan-no-Taki, a beautiful five tiered waterfall. A separate, more leveled trail leads back from the waterfall to the [bus](e2015.html) stop.

The trail through the valley is steep at times, and sturdy shoes are recommended. A visit to the Nishizawa Keikoku is particularly beautiful during the [autumn leaves](e2014.html) season, which usually reaches its peak in late October and early November.

A suspension bridge traverses the valley

The trailhead to the Nishizawa Gorge is a one hour [bus](e2015.html) ride (900 yen one way, 4 buses/day) from Yamanashishi Station along the frequently running JR Chuo Line (15 minutes, 240 yen one way from [Kofu](e6950.html)). Yamanashishi Station can be also reached from [Tokyo](e2164.html)'s [Shinjuku Station](e3011.html) by [limited express](e2016.html) train in about 80 minutes (3890 yen one way) or by [local](e2016.html) trains in about 2.5 hours (2310 yen, at least one transfer required along the way).
