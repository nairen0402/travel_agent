Hirado (平戸) is an island in northwestern [Nagasaki Prefecture](/list/e1240.html). Off-the-beaten path today, the island enjoyed brisk international trade in past centuries as one of Japan's closest points to the Asian mainland. In particular, it served as the [trading post of the Dutch East India Company](e4493.html) during the early [Edo Period](e2128.html) until the company's operations were moved to [Dejima](e4408.html) in [Nagasaki](e2162.html).

Early Western traders were accompanied by [Christian](e2298.html) missionaries, and the religion gained a bit of a foothold in Hirado and across Nagasaki Prefecture. However, as the religion's influence grew, the [Tokugawa Shogunate](e2128.html) responded by expelling missionaries and banning Christianity for more than two centuries. [Some Christians](e4495.html) in Hirado continued to practice their religion secretly until the ban on Christianity was lifted in the [Meiji Period](e2130.html).
