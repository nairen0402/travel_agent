Fukuyama (福山) is the second most populous city in [Hiroshima Prefecture](/list/e1238.html) after [Hiroshima City](e2160.html). It is located at the eastern end of the prefecture and midway along the coastline of the [Seto Inland Sea](e5445.html), not far from [Onomichi](e3475.html).

Fukuyama's city center is located a few kilometers inland around Fukuyama Station which stands directly adjacent to [Fukuyama Castle](e3433.html). Further south towards the water, tourists will find the noteworthy port town of [Tomonoura](e3432.html) and the unique [Shinshoji Temple](e3434.html).
