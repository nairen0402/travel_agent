Naruko Gorge (鳴子峡, Narukokyō) is one of the [Tohoku Region](/list/e1102.html)'s most scenic gorges. It is located in northwestern [Miyagi Prefecture](/list/e1206.html), about 70 kilometers from [Sendai](e5150.html) and just outside the small [hot spring](e2292.html) town of Naruko Onsen. Every year around late October to early November, the gorge transforms into one of the region's most popular [autumn color spots](e2014_where.html).

The gorge stretches about two kilometers east-west. The best area for [autumn leaf](e2014.html) viewing is around the **Narukokyo Resthouse** towards the western end of the gorge. The famous views of the Ofukazawa Bridge can be enjoyed from the observation deck next to the resthouse.

Along the main road there are several free parking areas and a large paid one close to the Narukokyo Resthouse. A few steep paths lead from the road to the bottom of the gorge, where the breathtaking **Naruko Gorge Walking Trail** runs the length of the ravine. Unfortunately, an earthquake in 2008 led to the closure of most of the trail, and today only short sections of it are open to tourists at each end between 9:00 and 16:00 (closed in bad weather).

The less dramatic **Ofukazawa Walking Trail** makes a loop west of the main road, starting around the Ofukazawa Bridge and ending at the Narukokyo Resthouse. This nature trail leads into a forested side valley and remains less crowded during the fall season. It takes about 45 minutes to complete the loop.

Towards the eastern end of the gorge stands the **Japan Kokeshi Museum**, which exhibits a large number of kokeshi dolls from the various prefectures of the [Tohoku Region](/list/e1102.html) and highlights the regional differences in the dolls' shapes and designs. Museum visitors can also watch an artisan make the dolls or purchase them at the museum shop. For a small fee, they can also try painting their own dolls.

Note: The train tracks of the JR Rikuu-to Line between Naruko Onsen and Shinjo were damaged in severe weather in 2024. Train service is expected to remain interrupted until at least 2027. Infrequent substitute buses are running in the meantime.

### From Sendai   *([how to get to Sendai](e5151.html))*

Take the [Tohoku Shinkansen](e2018_tohoku.html) to Furukawa and change to a [local train](e2016.html#category) on the JR Rikuu-to Line to Naruko Onsen. The entire trip takes approximately 90 minutes and costs 2400 yen one way with unreserved seats. Alternatively, take a local train on the JR Tohoku Line to Kogota and transfer to the JR Rikuu-to Line there (140 minutes, 1690 yen). Travelers from [Tokyo](e2164.html) can use the [Tohoku Shinkansen](e2018_tohoku.html) directly to Furukawa without stopping at [Sendai](e5150.html).

From Naruko Onsen Station, the gorge can be reached in a 10 minute [taxi](e2021.html) ride (around 2000 yen one way). During the autumn leaf season from late October to early November, buses operate temporarily from the station to the gorge (10-15 minutes, 400 yen one way; get off at Nakayamadaira-guchi) and onward to Nakayamadaira Onsen Station. On foot, it takes about 20-30 minutes to reach the eastern end of the gorge near the doll museum from the station and an additional 30-40 minutes to reach the western end around the resthouse.
