Inuyama (犬山), literally meaning "dog mountain", is a city in [Aichi Prefecture](/list/e1221.html), not far from [Nagoya](e2155.html). It is most famous for its small but beautiful [castle](e3351.html), which is one of Japan's oldest wooden castles, having survived the turmoils of wars and disasters over the centuries.

The picturesque Kiso River runs along the northern border of the city, where [cormorant fishing](e2426.html) takes place from June through mid October every year. Southeast of the city center is [Meiji Mura](e3353.html), a popular open air historical [theme park](e2067.html) based on the [Meiji Period](e2130.html) (1868-1912).
