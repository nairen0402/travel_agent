Above fees and schedules are subject to change. Be sure to check current yen [exchange rates](e2196.html).

Matsuyama has two main train stations: **JR Matsuyama Station** to the west of the city center and **Matsuyama-shi Station** (sometimes referred to as Matsuyama City Station), the main station of the local Iyotetsu Railway company in the south of downtown. [Matsuyama Castle](e5501.html) defines the city center, while [Dogo Onsen](e5502.html) is located on the northeastern outskirts of the city.

The most convenient way to travel around the city is by **tram**. Iyotetsu operates five tram lines across the city, connecting JR Matsuyama Station in the west to Matsuyama-shi Station in the south and [Dogo Onsen](e5502.html) area to the northeast. A tram ride costs 210 yen regardless of distance traveled if paying with an [IC card](e2359_003.html) or 230 yen if paying by cash. To use the tram, board through the rear door just like on [local buses](e2015.html) and pay the fare when alighting.

Tram in Matsuyama

Iyotetsu also operates an extensive [bus](e2015.html) network in [Matsuyama](e5500.html). For most tourists, the trams provide adequate access to all sightseeing areas. Three buses however, may be of interest: the first operates between Dogo Onsen and [Ishiteji Temple](e5503.html) (5 minutes, 230-250 yen). Two other buses shuttle passengers to Matsuyama Airport and Matsuyama Port (see below). On all buses, the use of an [IC card](e2359_003.html) over cash will result in a 20 yen fare reduction.

**Matsuyama Airport** lies on the city's southwestern boundary. Airport buses serve JR Matsuyama Station (980-1000 yen, 15 minutes), Matsuyama-shi Station (980-1000 yen, 20 minutes) and Dogo Onsen (1180-1200 yen, 35 minutes). Besides domestic destinations, Matsuyama Airport also has a few international flights to nearby Asian destinations.

**Matsuyama Port** (Matsuyama Sightseeing Port) is located northwest of the city center. From Matsuyama-shi Station, take the Iyotetsu Takahama Line to Takahama Station (20 minutes, 470-490 yen), from where the port is a short bus ride (2 minutes, 230-250 yen) or a 10-15 minute walk.
