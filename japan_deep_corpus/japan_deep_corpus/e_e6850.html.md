Shiretoko National Park (知床国立公園, Shiretoko Kokuritsu Kōen), located on the Shiretoko Peninsula in eastern [Hokkaido](/list/e1101.html), is one of Japan's most beautiful and unspoiled [national parks](e2325.html). No roads lead further than about three fourths up the peninsula, and the northern tip can only be viewed from [boats](e6852.html) or be reached on multi-day trekking tours.

The peninsula is home to a variety of wildlife, including brown bears, deer and foxes. In winter, the peninsula's coast along the Sea of Okhotsk becomes one of the northern hemisphere's southernmost regions to see [drift ice](e6860.html). In 2005, Shiretoko was added to the list of [World Heritage Sites](e2251.html) for the irreplaceable value of the peninsula's ecosystem and biodiversity.
