Opened in 2025, the Naoshima New Museum of Art (直島新美術館, Naoshima Shinbijutsukan) is the newest creation by Benesse on the [island](e5475.html), once more designed by star [architect](e2111_architects.html) Ando Tadao in his concrete-heavy style that plays with light and shadows.

The museum stands on a hill at the edge of Honmura village on the island's east coast, surrounded by greenery. On three floors it features four galleries of - mainly - rotating art by [contemporary artists](e2115.html) from Japan and other parts of Asia.

A nice cafe offering [Setouchi](e5445.html)-themed dishes, sweets and drinks, complements this thoroughly pleasant and intriguing art space.

There are 1-3 [buses](e2015.html) per hour from Miyanoura Ferry Terminal bound for Tsutsujiso that stop at the Momoyama bus stop in Honmura (8 minutes, 100 yen) along the way. Alternatively, it is a 2.5 kilometer [bicycle](e2210.html) ride (10 minutes) or walk (35-45 minutes) from the Miyanoura Ferry Terminal. Honmura has also its own port with less frequent [ferry](e2355.html) connections to Uno Port on Honshu (20 minutes, 300 yen). The museum is only a 5-10 minute walk from the port.
