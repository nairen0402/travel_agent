Kushiro (釧路) is a port city in eastern [Hokkaido](/list/e1101.html). The city is well known for [Kushiro Shitsugen](e6792.html), Japan's largest marshland. Dedicated as a [national park](e2325.html), the marshland is home to rare, wild Japanese red-crown cranes (tancho) that can be observed by tourists during the winter.

As a major fishing port city, Kushiro is naturally renowned for the fresh seafood that can be enjoyed at its restaurants. There is also a [public fish market](e6793.html) a short walk from the station. Although located over 50 kilometers inland from central Kushiro, [Lake Akan](e6801.html) is still within the borders of the expansive municipality.
