Covered by: [Japan Rail Pass](/e/e2361.html)

[Tokyo](e2164.html) and [Kitakyushu](e4875.html) (Kokura Station) are connected by the [Tokaido](e2018_tokaido.html)/[Sanyo Shinkansen](e2018_sanyo.html). The one way trip by direct [Nozomi](e2018_tokaido.html) trains takes about five hours and costs about 22,000 yen. The [Japan Rail Pass](e2361.html) fully covers the trip if using [Hikari](e2018_tokaido.html) and [Sakura](e2018_sanyo.html), but a supplement fee is required on Nozomi trains. The trip by Hikari and Sakura trains adds about one hour to the total travel time and requires a transfer of trains at Shin-Osaka Station.

[JAL and Starflyer](e2365.html) operate multiple [flights](e2365.html) per day between [Tokyo](e2164.html)'s [Haneda Airport](e2430.html) and [Kitakyushu](e4875.html), with ANA codesharing the Starflyer flights. Flight duration is just under two hours. The regular one way fare by JAL and ANA is around 50,000 yen, but [discount fares](e2364.html) are typically available for 20,000 to 34,000 yen. The fares by Starflyer are typically around 10 percent lower than those of JAL and ANA.

Ocean Tokyu Ferry operates daily [ferries](e2355.html) between Tokyo (Tokyo Ferry Terminal on [Odaiba](e3008.html)) and Kitakyushu (Shin-Moji Port) via [Tokushima](e7800.html). The one way journey takes 34 hours and costs around 20,000 yen in the second class.

Above fees and schedules are subject to change. Be sure to check current yen [exchange rates](e2196.html).

Kokura Station is the transport hub of [Kitakyushu](e4875.html) and a major station along the [Sanyo Shinkansen](e2018_sanyo.html). It is also served by the JR Sanyo Line in the direction of Honshu, the JR Kagoshima Line, which runs south towards [Fukuoka](e2161.html) and north to [Moji Port](e4878.html), and the JR Nippo Line, which runs in the direction of [Oita](/list/e1243.html). The Kitakyushu Monorail also departs from Kokura Station.

Most of [Kitakyushu](e4875.html)'s main tourist attractions are located within walking distance from a JR railway station with frequent connections to Kokura Station.

**Kitakyushu Airport** is located on a man-made island outside the city center and connected with Kokura Station by direct [buses](e2015.html) (40 minutes, 710 yen one way, about 1 bus/hour). Alternatively, the nearest train station to Kitakyushu Airport, JR Kusami Station, can be reached in a 20 minute [bus](e2015.html) ride (540 yen one way, about 2 buses/hour). From Kusami, it takes about 25 minutes and costs 340 yen one way to travel to Kokura Station by local train.

Most [long-distance ferries](e2355.html) to/from Kitakyushu use **Shin-Moji Port** ("New Moji Port", not to be confused with [Moji Port](e4878.html)) far outside the city center, including the ferries to/from [Osaka](e2157.html) and [Tokyo](e2164.html). Shin-Moji Port can be reached by shuttle buses operated by the ferry companies from Kokura Station (about 40 minutes) and Moji Station (about 20 minutes). However, the ferries to/from [Matsuyama](e5500.html) use the more central **Kokura Port**, which can be reached in a 15 minute walk from Kokura Station.
