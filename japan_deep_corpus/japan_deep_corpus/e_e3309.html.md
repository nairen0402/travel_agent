Noritake is a leading [Nagoya](e2155.html)-based company in the [ceramics](e2329.html) industry, with a history of over 100 years. The Noritake Garden (ノリタケの森, Noritake no Mori) was built on the company's former factory grounds and introduces the company and its products while providing a pleasant, recreational space in the middle of city.

In the **Craft Center**, visitors can observe the delicate creation process of porcelain, or try it themselves in a workshop. And the **Noritake Museum** introduces the diverse ceramics products produced by Noritake throughout history, which are not only limited to tableware, such as vases, jars and dishes, but also include various industrial products, electronics and cutting-edge technologies using ceramics.

The garden also includes a shop, cafe and restaurant. Furthermore, a large Aeon shopping mall was opened in 2021 adjacent to and named after the Noritake Garden.

Noritake Garden is a 15 minute walk north of Nagoya Station. It is also served by the [Meguru loop bus](e3302.html) line for tourists (12 minutes, 210 yen).
