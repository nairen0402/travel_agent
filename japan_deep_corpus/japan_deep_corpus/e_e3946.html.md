Opened in 2006, the Kyoto International Manga Museum (京都国際マンガミュージアム, Kyōto Kokusai Manga Museum) consists of three floors and a basement, and most of its walls are lined with shelves of [manga](e2070.html). Browsing this massive collection of manga is one of the museum's main attractions. A small section of the books is dedicated to foreign and translated manga, but the vast majority is in [Japanese](e621.html).

In addition to its massive collection of indigenous manga, the museum also focuses on both the adoption and development of manga internationally. Works of international manga artists are featured, and manga related events at the museum often involve foreign artists.

In addition to its permanent collection, the Manga Museum also features temporary exhibitions on various themes. The building, which now acts as the Manga Museum, was previously an elementary school. Some relics of the former school are on display for visitors.

The Kyoto International Manga Museum is located a two minute walk from the Karasuma-Oike Station (5 minutes, 220 yen from Kyoto Station by Karasuma Subway Line).
