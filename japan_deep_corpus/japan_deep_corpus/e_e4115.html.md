Yoshikien's Pond Garden

Yoshikien (吉城園) is a pleasant [Japanese garden](e2099.html) located in central [Nara](e2165.html). It is named after the Yoshikigawa River, a small river that runs beside the garden, and was built on the site of [Kofukuji Temple](e4101.html)'s former priest residences.

There are three unique gardens within Yoshikien: a pond garden, a moss garden and a [tea ceremony](e2096.html) garden. So, a visit to Yoshikien provides the opportunity to see three different variations of [Japanese gardens](e2099.html) in one spot. If visitors still want to see more techniques of Japanese gardening, the [Isuien Garden](e4114.html) is located just across the small river.

Yoshikien's Moss Garden

Located in central Nara, a visit to Yoshikien Garden is easily combined with seeing other attractions such as [Todaiji Temple](e4100.html) and [Kofukuji Temple](e4101.html), which are both a ten minute walk away.

Yoshikien Garden is also located a 15 minute walk from Kintetsu Nara Station. From JR Nara Station, the garden can be reached by taking frequently departing buses bound for Aoyamajutaku or Kunimidai-hacchome to Oshiagecho bus stop (10 minutes, 250 yen).
