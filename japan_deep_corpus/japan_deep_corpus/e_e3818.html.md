Okunikko (奥日光, Okunikkō, "Inner Nikko") is the mountainous region of [Nikko](e3800.html) that lies at a higher elevation, deeper into the mountains west of Nikko's city center. Part of [Nikko National Park](e2325.html), Okunikko offers beautiful natural scenery, including waterfalls, lakes, marshlands, streams and [hot springs](e2292.html).

Okunikko has long been a popular destination for escaping the heat of summer. Beautiful [hiking](e2427.html) trails attract outdoor lovers from spring to autumn, while winter scenery can be enjoyed during the rest of the year. The region also offers some of the most spectacular [autumn colors](e3817.html) near [Tokyo](e2164.html) during the month of October.
