[Shiretoko National Park](e6850.html) is located in the far east of [Hokkaido](/list/e1101.html). A visit can be combined with nearby [Akan National Park](e6800.html). A [rental car](e2024.html) is the recommended means of getting around since public transportation is rather infrequent.

The closest [airport](e2365.html) to Shiretoko National Park is Memanbetsu Airport with direct flights from/to [Tokyo](e2164.html) and [Sapporo](e2163.html), operated by JAL, ANA and Air Do, as well as seasonal connections to [Osaka](e2157.html) and [Nagoya](e2155.html). The airport is about 100 kilometers west of the national park.

There are a small number of direct [buses](e2015.html) between the airport and [Utoro](e6857.html) during summer (June to September) and winter (mid January to early March). The one way ride takes about two hours and costs 3500 yen.

Most of the easily accessible attractions of [Shiretoko National Park](e6850.html) are found along the western coast of the peninsula, making [Utoro](e6857.html) a good base for exploring the national park. Because getting around by public transportation is rather inconvenient, a [rental car](e2024.html) is the recommended means of transportation.

[Bus](e2015.html) service is rather infrequent, especially in winter. Year around, there are buses between Shiretoko Shari Station and [Utoro](e6857.html). In summer, infrequent buses connect Utoro with the [Shiretoko Five Lakes](e6853.html) and with [Rausu](e6859.html) via [Shiretoko Pass](e6858.html). During the peak of the summer, the unpaved access road to the [Kamuiwakkayu Falls](e6851.html) gets closed to private traffic, and shuttle buses operate instead.

The [Shiretoko Peninsula](e6850.html) receives a lot of snow during winter, and many of the national park's roads get closed from around late November to around late April, including the road over [Shiretoko Pass](e6858.html) and to the [Shiretoko Five Lakes](e6853.html) and the [Kamuiwakkayu Falls](e6851.html).
