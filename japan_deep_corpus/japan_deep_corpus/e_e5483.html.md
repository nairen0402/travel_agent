The Ando Museum opened in time for the [2013 Setouchi Triennale](e5410.html) in the Honmura town of [Naoshima](e5475.html) where it joins the buildings of the [Art House Project](e5479.html) as an additional magnet for [contemporary art](e2115.html) lovers. The museum is designed by the man it is named after, Ando Tadao, one of Japan's most famous [architects](e2111_architects.html) who also designed most other museums on Naoshima.

The Ando Museum looks like a regular, traditional residence from the outside, blending in perfectly into the town's neighborhood. The inside of the building, however, combines traditional interior design with Ando's signature use of concrete, creating a rather intriguing atmosphere. Explanatory signs and photographs along the walls document Ando's activities on [Naoshima](e5475.html) and elsewhere.

There are 1-3 [buses](e2015.html) per hour from Miyanoura Ferry Terminal bound for Tsutsujiso that stop at the Nokyo-mae bus stop in Honmura (5 minutes, 100 yen) along the way, from where it is a two minute walk to the Ando Museum. Alternatively, it is a 2.5 kilometer [bicycle](e2210.html) ride (10 minutes) or walk (35-45 minutes) from the Miyanoura Ferry Terminal. Honmura has also its own port with infrequent [ferry](e2355.html) connections to Uno Port.
