The Hakone Botanical Garden of Wetlands (箱根湿生花園, Hakone Shisseikaen) is a botanical garden in the highlands of Fuji Hakone Izu National Park. The park was founded in 1976 as a place to preserve and exhibit over 1700 varieties of marsh and alpine plants native to Japan.

The garden offers a network of boardwalk paths through different types of marshland where you can learn about the plants which populate the wetlands. Information signs are in English and [Japanese](e621.html). The garden is popular during June when its Nikko Kisuge (daylily) are in full bloom, however it is closed during the winter months.

The Hakone Botanical Garden of Wetlands is located in the Sengoku area of [Hakone](e5200.html) and can be reached by Hakone Tozan Bus along line T bound for Togendai from Hakone-Yumoto Station. Get off at the Sengoku Annaijo-mae bus stop (25 minutes, 950 yen, 4-5 buses per hour) from where it is about a 5 minute walk to the Botanical Garden.

Alternatively, take a Hakone Tozan Bus along line S from Gora Station, the last stop of the [Hakone Tozan Railway](e5202.html), to the Shissei Kaen-mae bus stop (20 minutes, 520 yen, 2-3 buses per hour) in front of the garden.
