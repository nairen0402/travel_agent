The Kerama Islands (慶良間諸島, Kerama Shotō) are a group of small islands in the East China Sea. Located only about 40 kilometers to the west of [Okinawa Main Island](e7101.html), the Kerama Islands are a popular side trip due to their pristine, white sand [beaches](e2461.html) and clear blue waters that are ideal for sunbathing, swimming, [snorkeling](e2424_snorkeling.html) and [diving](e2424_diving.html). From January to March, the islands are a popular destination for whale watching.

Kerama consists of 36 islands of which only four are inhabited, including the two largest islands, [Tokashiki](e7192.html) and [Zamami](e7193.html). The Kerama Islands were designated a [national park](e2325.html) in 2014.
