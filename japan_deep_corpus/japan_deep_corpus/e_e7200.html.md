The Yaeyama Islands (八重山列島, Yaeyama Rettō) are both the southernmost and westernmost inhabited islands of Japan. Together with the [Miyako Islands](e7300.html) and the [Okinawa Islands](e7100.html) they make up the three main island chains of [Okinawa Prefecture](/list/e1247.html).

With their tropical atmosphere and laid back, rural lifestyle, the Yaeyama Islands are a popular getaway destination for those wishing to escape the hustle and bustle of Japan's metropolises. This island paradise offers [beaches](e2461.html), [snorkeling](e2424_snorkeling.html), [diving](e2424_diving.html) and relaxation.

Of the Yaeyama Islands, [Ishigaki Island](e7201.html) is the most populated and serves as the region's transportation hub. Other islands include the jungle-covered [Iriomote Island](e7225.html) and [Taketomi Island](e7250.html), famous for its beautifully preserved, traditional Ryukyu village. Five additional islands comprise the rest of the island chain and offer [beaches](e2461.html), [snorkeling](e2424_snorkeling.html) and [diving](e2424_diving.html).
