[Kamakura](e2166.html) is home to several sand [beaches](e2461.html), which are popular getaways for those who want to escape the nearby cities of [Tokyo](e2164.html) and [Yokohama](e2156.html) for some sunbathing, swimming and surfing. The official beach season in Kamakura lasts from July to August.

Located adjacent to each other, Yuigahama and Zaimokuza are [Kamakura](e2166.html)'s two most popular beaches due to their convenient location and facilities. As a result, both get very crowded during the summer. The two beaches collectively span about one kilometer of coastline, providing a lot of space for sunbathing and swimming. Beach huts are open during the season and provide visitors with shade, changing and shower rooms, food and drinks.

The beaches are about a five minute walk from Yuigahama Station on the Enoden Railway or about twenty minutes on foot from JR Kamakura Station.
