Japan's ski season generally starts around December and lasts until April, with the best snow conditions found from mid January through February. Snow is abundant and temperatures moderate, barely dropping below -10 degrees.

While skiers outnumber snowboarders on most Japanese ski slopes, snowboarding also enjoys a big popularity, and many resorts provide snowboarding facilities, such as half pipes.

Many ski resorts in Japan are also [hot spring resorts](e2292.html), leading to the particular Japanese way of enjoying skiing in combination with a hot spring bath after a day on the slopes.

The typical cost of a one-day pass for large ski areas is around 7,000 to 11,000 [yen](e2196.html). Many resorts also offer half-day, multi-day, nighter and season passes. Furthermore, ski holiday [packages](e2275.html), which include [transportation](e627.html), lift passes and [accommodation](e2025.html), are available at competitive rates through travel agencies.

Renting ski and snowboard equipment is possible at virtually every ski resort across Japan. Typical prices are around 4000-8000 yen per day for a complete set (skis, boots and poles; or snowboard, boots and bindings). Similar prices apply to a one-day rental of ski wear, which usually includes a jacket, pants, gloves and goggles.

When using your own equipment, note that [delivery companies](e2278.html) provide convenient door-to-door shipment of skis and snowboards across the country for around 2000-3000 yen. Delivery typically takes two or three days.
