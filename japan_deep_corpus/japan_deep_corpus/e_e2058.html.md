Temples (寺, tera) are the places of worship in Japanese [Buddhism](e2055.html). Virtually every Japanese municipality has at least one temple, while large cultural centers like [Kyoto](e2158.html) have hundreds.

Temples store and display sacred Buddhist objects. Some temples used to be monasteries, and some still function as such. Structures typically found at Japanese temples are:

* 

  Main hall

  Example: Main hall of [Todaiji](e4100.html) in [Nara](e2165.html)

  The sacred objects of worship, such as statues, are displayed in the main hall. Depending on the sect and temple, the main hall is called kondo, hondo, butsuden, amidado or hatto in Japanese.
* 

  Lecture hall

  Example: Lecture hall of [Toji](e3919.html) in [Kyoto](e2158.html)

  Lecture halls are for meetings and lectures and often also display objects of worship. Lecture halls are called kodo.
* 

  Pagoda

  Example: 3-storied pagoda of [Kofukuji](e4101.html) in [Nara](e2165.html)

  The pagoda, a structure that has evolved from the Indian stupa, usually comes with three (sanju no to) or five (goju no to) stories. Pagodas store remains of the Buddha such as a tooth, usually in the form of a representation.
* 

  Gates

  Example: Sanmon Gate of [Kenchoji](e3104.html) in [Kamakura](e2166.html)

  Gates mark the entrance to the temple grounds. There is usually one main gate, and possibly several additional gates, along the temple's main approach.
* 

  Bell

  Example: Great Bell of [Kenchoji](e3104.html) in [Kamakura](e2166.html)

  On [New Year](e2064.html)'s Eve, temple bells are rung 108 times, corresponding to the Buddhist concept of 108 worldly desires.
* 

  Cemetery

  Most cemeteries in Japan are Buddhist and are located at temples. The Japanese visit their ancestors' graves on many occasions during the year, especially during the [obon](e2286.html) week, the equinoctial weeks and anniversaries.

The best cities to [visit temples](e2057.html) are [Kyoto](e2158.html), [Nara](e2165.html) and [Kamakura](e2166.html). One of the best places to overnight at temples is [Mount Koya](e4900.html).
