Amanohashidate (天橋立) is a pine-covered [sandbar](e3992.html) that spans the mouth of Miyazu Bay in the scenic, coastal region of northern [Kyoto Prefecture](/list/e1226.html). Viewed from the mountains at either end of the bay, the Amanohashidate Sandbar (which roughly translates to "bridge in heaven") looks like a pathway between heaven and earth. The scene has been admired for centuries and is ranked among Japan's [three most scenic views](e2250.html).

Several other attractions can be explored on foot or by rental bicycle at either end of the sandbar. They include a couple of [temples](e2058.html), a [shrine](e2059.html), a small amusement park and observation decks from which to enjoy the view. Visitors can further take sightseeing cruises around the bay or enjoy the [sand beaches](e2461.html) along the sandbar.
