Iga City (伊賀市, Iga-shi) was formed in 2004 with the merger of Ueno City and five surrounding towns and villages. The city is named after the former Iga Province, which covered part of today's [Mie Prefecture](/list/e1225.html). The city has been commonly referred to as Iga Ueno (伊賀上野) to avoid confusion with other places named Ueno.

Iga Ueno is most famous for [ninja](e2295.html). The Iga school of ninjutsu (art of stealth), based in the former Ueno City, used to be one of Japan's two leading ninja schools during the feudal era (the [Koka](e7025.html) school in neighboring [Shiga Prefecture](/list/e1224.html) was the other). Today, Iga Ueno attracts visitors with its fine [ninja museum](e4351.html).

Iga Ueno is also the birthplace of one of Japan's greatest poets, [Basho Matsuo](e4354.html), who lived during the early [Edo Period](e2128.html). A memorial museum, his birth home and a former hermitage are some of the city's Basho related sites.
