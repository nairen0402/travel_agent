Valencia-kan

Fukuda Farm (福田農場, Fukuda Nōjō), also known as Yunoko Spain Village, is located in the hills above [Yunoko Onsen](e4530.html), offering beautiful views over the rugged coastline of southern [Kyushu](/list/e1108.html) with its mandarin plantations.

The farm produces an array of homemade goods, including wines, beer, juices, jam, bread and salad dressing, which are sold at the souvenir shop and used in the dishes served at the farm's Valencia-kan, a restaurant specializing in Spanish dishes.

Visitors can pick a variety of mandarins in October and November, while various flowers can be enjoyed in bloom during all four seasons. There is also an exhibition of the owner's private collection of turtle figures and toys from across the world.

Fukuda Farm can be reached in a 15 minute [taxi](e4530.html) ride from Minamata Station for an estimated 1800-2000 yen. You can also walk there from [Yunoko Onsen](e4530.html) in about half an hour.
