Harusametei calligraphy room and pond in Tenshaen

Tenshaen Garden (天赦園) is a lovely mid-sized [Japanese garden](e2099.html) located southwest of [Uwajima Castle](e5577.html). It was built in 1866 as a recreational venue by the ruling lord from the Date Clan. The garden offers changing scenery according to the seasons and was favored by the lord as a spot to practice his calligraphy. Harusametei, an artistic-looking calligraphy room frequented by the lord, still stands at the center of the garden today.

In front of Harusametei is a pond in the shape of the [kanji](e2046.html) "kokoro", meaning "heart" in English. Photogenic views of the pond and Harusametei can be enjoyed together with strategically placed rocks, stone lanterns and pine trees that enhance the scenery. Around mid April, wisteria [flowers](e2423.html) are usually in bloom, including an arch bridge fully lined with white wisteria that spans over the pond. Bamboo groves are another feature of Tenshaen. Around 20 varieties of bamboo trees can be found here, providing a subtle charm to the garden year round.

Located next to [Date Museum](e5578.html), Tenshaen Garden can be reached in a 20-30 minute walk from Uwajima Station. Alternatively, Uwajima Bus operates hourly [buses](e2015.html) between the station and Tenshaen-mae bus stop (天赦園前, 10 minutes, 160 yen one way), which is situated a few steps from the garden.
