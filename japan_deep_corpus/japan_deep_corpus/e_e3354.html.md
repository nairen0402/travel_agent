[Inuyama](e3350.html) is located about half an hour north of [Nagoya](e2155.html). Meitetsu Railway provides the easiest access. An alternative approach by JR trains makes sense only if you have a [Japan Rail Pass](e2361.html), because it is considerably slower but saves pass holders 400 yen.

There are several direct trains per hour to Inuyama, departing from Meitetsu Nagoya Station, just next to JR Nagoya Station. The one way ride takes 25-30 minutes and cost 630 yen. Reserved seating is offered on board of some trains and costs an additional 450 yen.

Covered by: [Japan Rail Pass](/e/e2361.html)(except 180 yen for Unuma-Inuyama section)

The closest JR station to Inuyama is Unuma Station on the [Takayama](e5900.html) Line, where you have to transfer to a Meitetsu train to Inuyama. The Meitetsu Station is called Shin-Unuma Station, and trains take three minutes and 180 yen to Inuyama. From [Nagoya](e2155.html), Unuma Station can be reached by JR trains in about 50 minutes with a transfer at Gifu.

Above fees and schedules are subject to change. Be sure to check current yen [exchange rates](e2196.html).

[Urakuen](e3352.html) stands in the grounds of the Meitetsu Inuyama Hotel at the foot of [Inuyama Castle](e3351.html). Both are about a 15 minute walk west of Inuyama-Yuen Station or a 20 minute walk west of Inuyama Station. [Meiji Mura](e3353.html) is a 20 minute bus ride east of Inuyama Station.
