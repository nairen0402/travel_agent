The Narukawa Museum of Art (成川美術館, Narukawa Bijutsukan) is a contemporary art museum dedicated to a style of painting known as nihonga. Literally meaning "Japanese-style painting", nihonga are paintings that adhere to traditional Japanese artistic conventions, techniques, tools and materials. The label was originally meant to simply distinguish the art from Western-style paintings, but artists have since expanded the scope of nihonga to also include Western techniques.

Besides the art collection, the museum features an impressive panorama lounge and cafe with large windows overlooking [Lake Ashinoko](e5201.html). On a clear day, it affords one of the best views of [Mount Fuji](e2172.html), the lake and the floating torii gate of [Hakone Shrine](e5204.html).

The Narukawa Art Museum is located just across the street from the Moto-Hakone sightseeing boat pier on the south shore of [Lake Ashinoko](e5201.html). For more details, see our [access information for reaching Lake Ashinoko](e5201.html#section_get_there).
