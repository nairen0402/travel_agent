Below are maps of the train lines, which can be used with the Fukuoka Wide Pass:

### Validity

1. Unlimited use of [JR Kyushu](e2019.html) train lines shown on the map above, including on non-reserved seats of [limited express](e2016.html#category) trains.
2. The pass is **not** valid on any [shinkansen](e2018.html) trains. It is also not valid on any non-JR trains, such as on the subways in [Fukuoka](e4802.html) and on Nishitetsu trains.
3. The pass is valid on two consecutive days. The validity is based on calendar days (midnight to midnight) as opposed to 24-hour periods.

### Assessment

This pass can pay off relatively easily if you use trains around [Fukuoka](e2161.html) over relatively long distances. For example, it already pays off for a round trip by [limited express](e2016.html#category) train between [Hakata](e2161.html) and [Kokura](e4875.html) (which costs around 4000 yen with regular tickets), although it is still more expensive than regular tickets for the same trip by [local](e2016.html#category) trains (which cost 2620 yen).

### Alternative tickets

Instead of just [Fukuoka Prefecture](/list/e1242.html), the [Northern Kyushu Rail Pass](e2361_05.html) covers the entire northern half of [Kyushu](/list/e1108.html). Unlike the Fukuoka Wide Pass, it is valid also on the [Kyushu Shinkansen](e2018_kyushu.html) and [Nishikyushu Shinkansen](e2018_nishikyushu.html).
