Minshuku (民宿) are family-operated, Japanese-style bed and breakfasts. They offer visitors a good opportunity to meet local families and experience the traditional Japanese lifestyle. Minshuku are typically located around tourist areas such as [hot springs](e2292.html), [ski resorts](e2262.html) and in the mountains. They are also commonly found in smaller countryside cities and towns or by the sea. A popular place for tourists to experience a minshuku is around [Shirakawa-go](e5950.html) and [Gokayama](e5950.html) where visitors can stay in historic [traditional farmhouses](e5952.html).

Typical rates for minshuku range between 5,000 and 14,000 [yen](e2196.html) per person and night, including a home-style dinner and breakfast. Some minshuku may serve only breakfast or no meals, at all. Minshuku tend to be small with just a few guest rooms. In-room amenities tend to be basic and typically include a small television, a small table, a heater, a tea set and towels. Some older minshuku may not have locks on room doors.

Similar to [ryokan](e2029.html), minshuku offer Japanese-style [tatami](e2007.html) rooms with [futon](e2007.html) bedding to sleep on. During daytime, the futon are stored in a closet, and you may need to get them out yourself when you are ready to turn in for the night. Minshuku guests also have the opportunity to take a [Japanese-style bath](e2002.html) in the evening, but note that the bathroom and toilet facilities are usually shared with other guests. Dinner and breakfast, when included, are usually served in a common dining room.

Many reservation websites, including [Agoda](https://www.agoda.com/?site_id=25544) and [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/?aid=371183), include some minshuku in their databases. Reservations can also be made by phone or through local tourism associations.
