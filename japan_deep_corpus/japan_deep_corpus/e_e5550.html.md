Uchiko (内子) is a pleasant town located about 40 kilometers southwest of [Matsuyama](e5500.html) in [Ehime Prefecture](/list/e1235.html). Now a vestige of traditional, rural Japan, Uchiko was once a prosperous center of wax and paper production. One of the town's main attractions, the [Kamihaga Residence](e5553.html), explores this historical industry.

[Yokaichi Old Town](e5552.html) is Uchiko's preserved street of houses where most of the town's attractions can be found. This historical district looks just as it did over 100 years ago, when wealth and prosperity came to Uchiko through its wax trade.

Another symbol of Uchiko is found outside of the old district: [Uchiko-za](e5554.html) is a full scale [kabuki](e2090.html) theater equipped with trap doors, hidden entrances and a rotating stage.
