At least two full days are needed to get a taste of [Kyoto](e2158.html); however, the city is extremely rich in history and culture, and you could easily spend a week exploring Japan's ancient capital and not run out of first-class attractions to visit.

### Suggested full-day schedules

* 

  [Eastern Kyoto Full Day](e3950_eastern_kyoto_full.html)

  A full day exploration of [Kyoto](e2158.html)'s eastern hills, this walking itinerary includes many of the city's most popular temples and shrines including [Kiyomizudera](e3901.html), [Ginkakuji](e3907.html), [Yasaka Shrine](e3903.html), [Heian Shrine](e3904.html) and [Nanzenji](e3905.html). The route also leads through the narrow streets of the [Higashiyama District](e3959.html) and along the [Philosopher's Path](e3906.html).
* 

  [Arashiyama Full Day](e3950_arashiyama_full.html)

  This full day itinerary includes the major sites in [Arashiyama](e3912.html), such as [Tenryuji Temple](e3913.html), the [bamboo groves](e3912.html#bamboo) and the [monkey park](e3912.html#monkey), in addition to the quiet streets and small temples in the quaint, rural district north of Arashiyama. Best done by [rental bicycle](e2210.html).

### Suggested half-day schedules

* 

  [Higashiyama Half Day](e3950_higashiyama_half.html)

  Essentially the southern half of our [Eastern Kyoto Full Day itinerary](e3950_eastern_kyoto_full.html), this half day plan covers the most popular temples of the [Higashiyama District](e3959.html) plus the popular [Gion](e3902.html) entertainment district. This is one of our most highly recommended itineraries for first-time visitors to [Kyoto](e2158.html).
* 

  [Philosopher's Path Half Day](e3950_philosophers_half.html)

  This is basically the northern half of our [Eastern Kyoto Full Day itinerary](e3950_eastern_kyoto_full.html). It leads along the [Philosopher's Path](e3906.html) and makes stops at [Ginkakuji](e3907.html), [Nanzenji Temple](e3905.html) and [Heian Shrine](e3904.html) along the way to [Gion](e3902.html).
* 

  [Arashiyama Half Day](e3950_arashiyama_half.html)

  [This walking tour](e3950_arashiyama_half.html) is a shortened version of our [full day plan](e3950_arashiyama_full.html) and sticks to the main attractions around central [Arashiyama](e3912.html) including [Tenryuji Temple](e3913.html), the [bamboo groves](e3912.html#bamboo) and the [monkey park](e3912.html#monkey).
* 

  [Northern Kyoto Half Day](e3950_northern_kyoto_half.html)

  Recommended for first-time visitors, [this plan](e3950_northern_kyoto_half.html) covers some of the city's most iconic attractions including the [Kinkakuji](e3908.html) (Golden Pavilion) and [Ryoanji](e3909.html) with its world famous Zen garden.

### Suggested side trips

* 

  [Nara](e2165.html)

  [Nara](e2165.html), less than one hour south of Kyoto, was Japan's first permanent capital and remains full of historic treasures, particularly some of the country's oldest [temples](e2058.html). While half a day is enough to cover just [Todaiji Temple](e4100.html) and its surroundings, a full day is recommended to better appreciate central Nara. Two days are needed to also cover the attractions outside of central Nara, such as [Horyuji](e4104.html).
* 

  [Himeji](e3500.html)

  [Himeji Castle](e3501.html) is Japan's best preserved, remaining feudal [castle](e2296.html). From Kyoto it can be reached by [shinkansen](e2018.html) in 50 minutes. The cheaper, special rapid train takes about 85 minutes for one way.
* 

  [Mount Koya](e4900.html)

  [Mount Koya](e4900.html) is the center of [Shingon Buddhism](e2055.html) and one of the holiest places in Japan. Visitors can [stay overnight at a temple](e4905.html).
* 

  [Osaka](e2157.html)

  [Osaka](e2157.html), only 15 minutes by [shinkansen](e2018.html) from Kyoto, is the center of western Japan, offering various attractions to travelers.
* 

  [Kobe](e2159.html)

  [Kobe](e2159.html) is an attractively situated port city, 30 minutes west of Kyoto by [shinkansen](e2018.html). Devastated by an earthquake in 1995, the city has fully recovered in the meantime.
* 

  [Kinosaki](e3525.html)

  [Kinosaki](e3525.html) is a charming [hot spring](e2292.html) town about 2.5 hours north of [Kyoto](e2158.html) along the coast of the Sea of Japan. Visitors can experience the nostalgic feel of an old-fashioned hot spring town as they stroll about in the evenings dressed in [yukata](e2103.html) and geta (wooden clogs).
