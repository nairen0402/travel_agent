Kamakura (鎌倉) is a coastal town in [Kanagawa Prefecture](/list/e1215.html), less than an hour south of [Tokyo](e2164.html). The town became Japan's political center, when [Minamoto Yoritomo](e2133.html) chose it as the seat for his new military government in [the late 12th century](e2133.html). The Kamakura government continued to rule Japan for over a century, first under the Minamoto [shogun](e2127.html) and then under the Hojo regents.

After the decline of the Kamakura government in the 14th century and the establishment of its successor, the [Muromachi government](e2134.html) in [Kyoto](e2158.html), Kamakura remained the political center of eastern Japan for some time before losing its position to other cities.

Today, Kamakura is a small city and a very popular tourist destination. Sometimes called the Kyoto of eastern Japan, Kamakura offers numerous [temples](e2058.html), [shrines](e2059.html) and other [historical](e641.html) monuments. In addition, Kamakura's [sand beaches](e3109.html) attract large crowds during the summer.
