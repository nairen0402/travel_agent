  [Day 1 - Tokyo to Dewa Sanzan via Niigata](e7900.html)

  Head to [Dewa Sanzan](e7900.html) via [Niigata](/list/e1207.html) and start exploring the area.
* 

  [Day 2 - Dewa Sanzan](e7900.html)

* 

  [Day 3 - Dewa Sanzan to Zao](e7929.html)

  Leave [Dewa Sanzan](e7900.html) early and head to [Zao](e7925.html), a volcanic mountain range with [hot spring town](e2292.html) and nice [hiking](e2427_where.html) (in summer) and [skiing](e2262.html) (in winter) opportunities. Overnight in Zao.
* 

  [Day 4 - Zao to Sendai via Yamadera](e7940.html)

  [Day 7 - Nyuto Onsen to Lake Towada](e3778.html)
