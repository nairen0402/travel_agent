The Sumida Aquarium (すみだ水族館, Sumida Suizokukan) is one of the main attractions of the [Tokyo Skytree Town](e3064_town.html). The moderately sized and beautifully designed modern [aquarium](e2425.html) houses over 10,000 sea creatures on the 5th and 6th floors of [Tokyo Solamachi](e3064_solamachi.html), a shopping and entertainment complex at the base of the [Tokyo Skytree](e3064.html).

The centerpiece of the aquarium is its 350 thousand liter tank, the largest open indoor tank in Japan, which is home to dozens of penguins and several fur seals. The tank is designed with thick, clear glass walls with almost no visible supports to obscure your view, and allows visitors to see the animals from virtually any angle. The aquarium also features an excellent jellyfish display and research laboratory, as well as tanks representing the habitats around Tokyo Bay, the Izu Islands and the [Ogasawara Islands](e8200.html).
