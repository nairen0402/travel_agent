Koishikawa Botanical Garden (小石川植物園, Koishikawa Shokubutsuen) belongs to the nearby Tokyo University, Japan's most prestigious university. It exhibits and preserves a few thousand tree and plant species and includes a beautiful Japanese [landscape garden](e2099.html).

Koishikawa Botanical Garden is also one of [Tokyo](e2164.html)'s most pleasant and interesting places for [cherry blossom viewing](e2011.html), because it does not get as crowded as other hanami spots and features cherry trees of various [varieties](e2011_species.html). It is not to be confused with [Koishikawa Korakuen](e3034_003.html), a nearby garden, which is also named after the Koishikawa district.

Koishikawa Botanical Garden is a 10-15 minute walk from either Myogadani Station on the Marunouchi Subway Line or Hakusan Station on the Mita Subway Line.
