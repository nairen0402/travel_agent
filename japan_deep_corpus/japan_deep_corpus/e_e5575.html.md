Uwajima (宇和島) is a coastal city in southern [Ehime Prefecture](/list/e1235.html), facing the Bungo Channel that separates [Kyushu](/list/e1108.html) from [Shikoku](/list/e1107.html). The small city is home to one of only twelve extant original [castles](e2296.html) from the [feudal age](e2128.html), while the [Date Museum](e5578.html) recollects the history of Uwajima and the Date clan which ruled the region around Uwajima for around two and a half centuries.

Being a coastal city, Uwajima supports a couple of industries related to the sea, such as fishing and pearl cultivating. It is one of the top pearl producers in Japan. Famous local dishes include Taimeshi (sea bream on rice) and Jakoten (fish cake). The waterfront around the city offers great coastal scenery. Uwajima is also known for its [bull fighting tradition](e5581.html).
