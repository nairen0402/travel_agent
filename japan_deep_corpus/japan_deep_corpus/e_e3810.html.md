Kanmangafuchi Abyss (憾満ヶ淵) was formed by an eruption of nearby Mount Nantai. This gorge near central [Nikko](e3800.html) is only a few hundred meters long and can be enjoyed from a pleasant riverside walking trail.

Kanmangafuchi is also known for its row of about 70 stone statues of Jizo, a Bodhisattva who cares for the deceased. This particular group of Jizo statues is alternatively called "Bake Jizo" (Ghost Jizo), "Narabi Jizo" (Jizo in a line) or "Hyaku Jizo" (100 Jizo). The statues look out over the river and across to the [Nikko Botanical Garden](e3809.html), but the botanical garden cannot be entered from the abyss.

From JR or Tobu Nikko Station, take a Tobu [bus](e2015.html) bound for [Chuzenji Onsen](e3806.html) or [Yumoto Onsen](e3807.html) and get off at the Tamozawa bus stop. The bus ride takes 10 minutes and costs 350 yen one way. From the bus stop, the trail begins after a 10-15 minute walk through a residential area.

The Kanmangafuchi Abyss can also be reached in about a 30 minute walk from [Toshogu Shrine](e3801.html).
