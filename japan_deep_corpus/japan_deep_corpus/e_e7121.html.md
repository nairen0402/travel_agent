Ryukyu Mura (Ryukyu Village, 琉球村) is a small theme park about traditional [Okinawan](/list/e1247.html) culture in the form of a recreated village from the times of the [Ryukyu Kingdom](e7125.html).

The village includes a traditional residence with a red tiled roof and surrounding stone walls for protection against [typhoons](e2117.html), a shrine and various workshops where visitors may participate in [hands-on experiences](e2424.html) such as [pottery](e2329.html), playing the sanshin guitar, weaving a coaster or painting a small shisa statue.
