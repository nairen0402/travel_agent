Nakamurake (中村家) is a traditional [Okinawan](/list/e1247.html)-style house, dating from the 18th century, when it served as the residence of the Nakamura family. Nakamurake has been designated a major cultural asset by the [Japanese government](e2136.html) and is open to the public.

Nakamurake displays many typical characteristics of a wealthy Okinawan farmer's residence, such as a red tiled roof with statues of shisa, lion-like creatures that ward off evil spirits and are omnipresent in [Okinawa](/list/e1247.html), and a stone wall and high trees for protection against the frequent [typhoons](e2117.html). It is recommended to combine a visit to Nakamurake with a visit to the nearby [Nakagusuku Castle Ruins](e7107.html).
