Utsunomiya (宇都宮) is the capital of [Tochigi](/list/e1210.html) and the largest city in the prefecture, located less than an hour north of [Tokyo](e2164.html) by [shinkansen](e2018.html) and just southeast of the famous shrines and temples of [Nikko](e3800.html). A modern-day commercial center, the area has roots in the mining industry, and the local [Oya stone](e3862.html) has been quarried over the centuries to be used as building material.

Utsunomiya is probably best known for its [gyoza](/r/e107.html), small meat and vegetable dumplings served pan-fried, deep fried or boiled. The city is home to dozens of restaurants specializing in the dish, which come filled with a whole host of ingredients including pork, kimchi, seafood and other fillings. Utsunomiya regularly ranks among the cities with the highest annual household consumption of the dumplings, a title it tends to trade back and forth with rivals Hamamatsu City in [Shizuoka Prefecture](/list/e1218.html) and [Miyazaki City](e8000.html).
