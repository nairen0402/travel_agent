In Japan, people greet each other by bowing.

A bow can ranges from a small nod of the head to a deep bend at the waist. A deeper, longer bow indicates respect, and conversely a small nod with the head is casual and informal. If the greeting takes place on [tatami floor](e2007.html), people get on their knees to bow. Bowing is also used to thank, apologize, make a request or ask someone a favor. Bowing with your palms together at chest level, as done in Thailand, is not customary in Japan.

Most Japanese do not expect foreigners to know proper bowing rules, and a nod of the head is usually sufficient. Shaking hands is uncommon, but exceptions are made, especially in international business situations.

At formal meetings, [business cards](e2227.html) are exchanged during the introductions.

At [shops](e2450.html) and [restaurants](e2040.html), customers are typically welcomed by the staff with the greeting "irasshaimase". No response from the customer is required, and a smile and a nod with the head would suffice for those who want to reciprocate the greeting.
