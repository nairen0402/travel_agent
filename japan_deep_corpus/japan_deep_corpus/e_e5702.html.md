Okayama Castle (岡山城, Okayamajō), also known as "crow castle" due to its black exterior, was built in 1597 in the style of the [Azuchi-Momoyama Period](e2123.html). The original castle was destroyed in the last year of [World War 2](e2129.html), but a reconstruction was made in 1966. The castle is located on the Asahi River, which was used as a moat, just across from [Korakuen Garden](e5701.html).

Only one of Okayama Castle's original buildings escaped destruction during the war, the Tsukimi Yagura ("moon viewing turret"), which dates back to 1620. There are also reconstructions and unearthed foundations of a few other former buildings, which help illustrate the former extent of the castle complex.

Inside the six-story castle keep are exhibits relating to the history and development of the [castle](e2296.html). Furthermore, there is a [pottery](e2329.html) studio in the castle park where visitors can craft Bizen-yaki, a pottery type local to [Okayama Prefecture](/list/e1232.html) (advance reservations recommended).

Pottery studio

Okayama Castle is about 1.5 kilometers or a 25-30 minute walk east of Okayama Station. Trams on the Higashiyama Line can be taken to Shiroshita stop (5 minutes, 120 yen, frequent departures) from where the castle keep can be reached in a 10-15 minute walk.
