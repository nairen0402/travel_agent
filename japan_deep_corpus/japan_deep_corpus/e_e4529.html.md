Yunotsuru Onsen (湯の鶴温泉, literally: "crane of hot water") is a small [hot spring](e2292.html) town in the mountains not far from central [Minamata](e4525.html), still located within the municipal limits of Minamata City. According to legend, the hot spring was discovered by an injured crane. Its waters are known to be effective in healing wounds.

The pleasantly run-down hot spring town stretches for just a few hundred meters along the central river in a very calm and rural setting. There are about half a dozen [ryokan](e2029.html), many of which also open their baths to day-trippers for an admission fee of typically 300 to 500 yen.

Yunotsuru Onsen can be reached from Minamata Station by infrequent [buses](e2015.html) (35 minutes, 150 yen one way, every 1-3 hours). By [car](e2024.html), it takes about 20 minutes from central Minamata.
