Designated as one of Japan's best 100 waterfalls, Oshinkoshin Falls (オシンコシンの滝, Oshinkoshin-no-taki) is a spectacular waterfall just next to the coastal main road from Shari to [Utoro](e6857.html). The waterfall is also nicknamed "Sobi no Taki", meaning twin beauties waterfall, as the stream is split into two visible falls.

A short flight of steps leads to a viewing platform about halfway to the top of the waterfall, from where visitors are within a couple of meters from the water. A free parking lot, public toilets and a souvenir shop are located nearby.

### By car

The waterfall is located immediately next to Route 334 between Shari Town Center and [Utoro](e6857.html), about five car minutes south of Utoro.

### By bus

Buses between the town center of Shari and the national park make a brief stop at Oshinkoshin Falls.
