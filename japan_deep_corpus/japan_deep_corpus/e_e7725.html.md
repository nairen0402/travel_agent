Fukushima (福島) is the capital city of [Fukushima Prefecture](/list/e1208.html) in the [Tohoku Region](/list/e1102.html) of Japan. Located along the foothills of the [Azuma](e7754.html) mountain range about 40 kilometers inland from the Pacific Ocean, Fukushima is not a major tourist destination, but offers a variety of natural and seasonal attractions including [hot springs](e2292.html), [hiking trails](e2427.html) in spectacular [volcanic](e2327.html) landscapes, and [Hanamiyama](e7728.html), one of Japan's most pleasant [cherry blossom spots](e2011.html).

Fukushima's city center lies 60 kilometers northwest of the [Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant](/news/0018.html) and never had to be evacuated.
