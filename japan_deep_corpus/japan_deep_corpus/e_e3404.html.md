Above fees and schedules are subject to change. Be sure to check current yen [exchange rates](e2196.html).

[Hiroshima](e2160.html) has Japan's largest **tram network** with eight tram lines connecting Hiroshima Station with most of the city's attractions. Tram line number 2 goes as far as Miyajima-guchi, from where ferries depart to [Miyajima](e3401.html). The fare for a single tram ride is a flat 240 yen. The [Japan Rail Pass](e2361.html) is not valid on the trams.

The trams enter Hiroshima Station on its second floor, allowing for convenient transfers to/from trains

Major [IC cards](e2359_003.html), including Suica and Icoca, can be used to pay the fare on trams and buses in Hiroshima and on the ferries to [Miyajima](e3454.html) (both companies).

Alternatively, a **one-day pass** for unlimited use of all trams on one calendar day is available for 700 yen. For an additional 300 yen, you get a one-day pass that also includes the ferry ride to Miyajima by Matsudai ferry (but not by JR ferry) and back (including the 100 yen visitor tax). Holders of these one-day passes, furthermore, qualify for a discount on the [Miyajima Ropeway](e3451.html) (1500 yen instead of 2000 yen). Note that the various passes are available as [digital tickets](https://www.mobiry.jp/en/).

The JR-operated **Hiroshima Sightseeing Loop Buses**, called Meipuru-pu (combination of Maple and Loop), serve all of central Hiroshima's major sightseeing attractions (see map above). There are three routes: the orange, green and lemon routes. The lemon route is the most frequent with 3-4 departures per hour, while the other two routes operate once per hour. The buses are covered by the [Japan Rail Pass](e2361.html) and several regional [JR passes](e2357.html). Without a rail pass, they cost 240 yen per ride or 600 yen for a 1-day pass.

Good walkers will also be able to cover the roughly three kilometers from Hiroshima Station via [Shukkeien](e3403.html) and [Hiroshima Castle](e3402.html) to the [Peace Memorial Park](e3400.html) on foot.
