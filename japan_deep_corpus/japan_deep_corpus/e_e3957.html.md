Take no Michi

Take no Michi (竹の径) - or "Bamboo Path" - is a paved walking trail about one and a half kilometers long that winds through the bamboo groves of the Muko Hills on the southwestern outskirts of [Kyoto](e2158.html), between the cities of Muko and Kyoto. It offers a calmer alternative to the busy bamboo grove of [Arashiyama](e3912.html).

The bamboo groves of Muko have been famous for centuries for their high-quality bamboo shoots, a [Kyoto spring delicacy](e3963.html). Along the path, visitors can learn about one other traditional use of the bamboo: eight different styles of bamboo fences line various sections of the trail, each accompanied by signs explaining their design.

About halfway along the route lies the **Rakusai Bamboo Park** with a small network of walking trails and many different bamboo varieties. At the center stands a small museum which explores the biological, artistic, practical and technological aspects of the versatile plant.

Rakusai Bamboo Park

The northern starting point of the Take no Michi can be reached in a 20 minute walk from Rakusaiguchi Station along the Hankyu Kyoto Line (15 minutes, 200 yen one way from Kyoto-Kawaramachi Station in central Kyoto) or in a 30 minute walk from Katsuragawa Station along the JR Kyoto Line (6 minutes, 180 yen one way from [Kyoto Station](e3922.html)). The walk can be cut short by taking a [bus](e2015.html) from either station to Muko Kaisei Byoin-mae bus stop (向日回生病院前, 3-6 minutes, 190 yen one way).

The southern starting point of the Take no Michi can be reached in a 20 minute walk from Higashimuko Station along the Hankyu Kyoto Line (20 minutes, 240 yen one way from Kyoto-Kawaramachi Station) or in a 30 minute walk from Mukomachi Station along the JR Kyoto Line (8 minutes, 200 yen one way from Kyoto Station). The walk can be cut short by taking a [bus](e2015.html) from either station to the Higashiyama bus stop (東山, 10-20 minutes, 180 yen one way).
