The Aomori Museum of Art (青森県立美術館, Aomori Kenritsu Bijutsukan) is a modern art museum found just outside of downtown [Aomori City](e3750.html). The building houses both temporary and permanent exhibits, and was designed to resemble the [Sannai Maruyama Jomon Archaeological Sites](e3753.html) next door. Instead of being built entirely above ground, the display spaces are dug into the earth like the trenches of an archaeological excavation site, while the museum building is painted white like tents that are stretched over the trenches.

The museum's permanent collection includes three impossibly large paintings by Marc Chagall, that were originally backdrops for a ballet performance, which are shown in a room with 19 meter high ceilings. Other works displayed in the permanent collection includes woodblock prints and paintings by Munakata Shiko, the pop art and almost cartoonish work of Nara Yoshitomo, as well as a huge 8.5 meter tall Aomori-Ken dog statue also by Nara.

The museum is located next to the Kenritsu Bijutsukanmae bus stop (県立美術館前), a 20 minute, 280 yen [bus](e2015.html) ride from Aomori Station. It is also a five minute walk from the [Sannai Maruyama Jomon Archaeological Site](e3753.html).
