With over 700,000 residents, Shizuoka (静岡) is a medium sized city situated halfway between [Tokyo](e2164.html) and [Nagoya](e2155.html). It is the capital of [Shizuoka Prefecture](/list/e1218.html). The main city center is located around Shizuoka Station, while Shimizu and its [port](e6354.html) make up a secondary center, which was only recently merged into the city. Like the prefecture, the city is known for its [tea leaves](e2041.html) and scenic views of [Mount Fuji](e2172.html).

The city has a long history dating back to the [Nara Period](e2132.html) (710-784), when it was the capital of the Suruga Province. The prosperity of the town greatly improved in the early 1600s when [Tokugawa Ieyasu](e2128.html), the founder of the [Tokugawa Shogunate](e2128.html), made the local [Sumpu Castle](e6352.html) his retirement home. One of the most famous shrines dedicated to Ieyasu is located on nearby [Mount Kunozan](e6353.html).
