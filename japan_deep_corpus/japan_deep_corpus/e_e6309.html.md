The Izu Shoboten Zoo (伊豆シャボテン動物公園, Izu Shaboten Dōbutsukōen, "Izu Cactus Zoo") is a mixture between botanical and zoological garden. It is located besides the strikingly shaped, grass-covered [Mount Omuro](e6315.html), a volcanic cone near central [Ito](e6307.html) on the [Izu Peninsula](e6310.html).

More than one thousand cactus varieties from around the world are exhibited in the park's greenhouses, while animals living there include birds, rodents and monkeys.

Cacti at the Izu Cactus Zoo

Take a [bus](e2015.html) from Ito Station (40 minutes, 880 yen one way, 2 buses/hour) or Izu Kogen Station (20 minutes, 430 yen one way, every 1-2 hours) in direction of Shaboten Koen (シャボテン公園) and get off at the final stop from where it is a short walk up the hill to the Cactus Park.

Tokai Bus offers two different [discount bus passes for Ito](e6307.html#section_get_there): a 1-day pass for 1250 yen that covers Izu Kogen and the [Jogasaki Coast](e6308.html), and a 2-day pass for 1800 yen that additionally includes [central Ito](e6307.html). The trip to the Cactus Park from Izu Kogen Station is fully covered by both passes, but the trip from Ito Station is only covered by the 2-day pass. The passes can be purchased at Izu Kogen Station and Ito Station, respectively.
