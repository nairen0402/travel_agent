There are multiple [trains](e2019.html) per hour between [Sapporo](e2163.html) and [Otaru](e6700.html) along the JR Hakodate Main Line. The one way trip costs 800 yen and takes 30 minutes by [rapid](e2016.html) train or 45 minutes by [local](e2016.html) train. About two trains per hour continue on to [New Chitose Airport](e2435.html) (70 minutes, 2040 yen one way).

Otaru Port is connected by [ferries](e2355.html) with the ports of Niigata (18 hours, from around 8500 yen in the cheapest class) and Maizuru (20 hours, from around 12,000 yen in the cheapest class). The Otaru Ferry Terminal is a ten minute [bus](e2015.html) ride from Otaru-Chikko Station or a 30 minute bus ride or ten minute [taxi](e2021.html) ride from Otaru Station.

Above fees and schedules are subject to change. Be sure to check current yen [exchange rates](e2196.html).

Most of [Otaru](e6700.html)'s attractions are located less than a 30 minute walk from Otaru Station, making the city convenient to explore by foot. The [herring mansions](e6703.html) are an exception, but are connected to the canal area and Otaru Station by relatively frequent [buses](e2015.html).

Complementing the regular city [bus](e2015.html) network, the **Otaru Stroller's** tourist buses used to connect Otaru Station with all of the city's tourist attractions before the coronavirus pandemic; however, they remain out of service as of now.
