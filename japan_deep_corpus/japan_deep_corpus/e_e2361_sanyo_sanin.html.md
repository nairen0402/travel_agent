### Seat reservations

Seat reservations can be made at no additional cost at ticket offices. The first six reservations can alternatively be made at ticket machines, but subsequent reservations can be made only at ticket offices. Furthermore, those who purchased their pass through the [official JR West website](https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/) can also use the JR West website to make seat reservations, but the website is not very easy to use.

### Assessment

The JR Sanyo Sanin Area Pass can be a very good value for exploring the Sanyo and Sanin coasts of the [Chugoku Region](/list/e1106.html), especially if using the [Sanyo Shinkansen](e2018_sanyo.html). For example, it will already almost pay off for a single [shinkansen](e2018.html) round trip between [Osaka](e2157.html) and [Hiroshima](e2160.html).

### Alternative tickets

For travelers who explore only a limited part of the Chugoku Region there exist a variety of cheaper rail passes with more restricted coverage areas, including the [Kansai Hiroshima Area Pass](e2361_kansai_hiroshima.html), the [Hiroshima Yamaguchi Area Pass](e2361_hiroshima_yamaguchi.html), the [Okayama Hiroshima Yamaguchi Area Pass](e2361_okayama_yamaguchi.html), the [Sanin Okayama Area Pass](e2361_sanin.html) and the [Kansai Wide Area Pass](e2361_08.html). The [Sanyo Sanin Northern Kyushu Pass](e2361_sanyo_sanin_kyushu.html), on the other hand, is worth considering by those who additionally visit [Kyushu](/list/e1108.html).
