The Tobe House (戸部家住宅, Tobe-ke Jūtaku) is a farmhouse, dating back to the [Edo Period](e2128.html) (1603-1868), which has been relocated to and preserved in central [Minakami](e7460.html). The interior of the house has been restored to how it looked during the daily lives of people of that era.

Next door to the Tobe House stands the Minakami History Museum, a small folk museum (currently closed indefinitely) which displays clothes, household goods, farming tools and other implements used in the daily lives of the residents of Minakami's past.

Inside Tobe House

Tobe House and the Minakami History Museum are a 15-20 minute walk from Minakami Station. Alternatively take a bus bound for Jomo Kogen Station to the Kankō Kaikan-mae bus stop (観光会館前, 3 minutes, 290 yen, 1-2 buses/hour) from where the Tobe house and museum are a few steps.
