[Rishiri Island](e6876.html) (利尻島, Rishiritō) and [Rebun Island](e6877.html) (礼文島, Rebuntō) are two small islands near the northern tip of [Hokkaido](/list/e1101.html). The islands are part of the Rishiri-Rebun-Sarobetsu National Park and offer beautiful hiking trails, coastal sceneries, alpine flowers and small fishing villages.

[Rishiri](e6876.html) is a round island with the 1721 meter tall Mount Rishiri at its center. The volcano is also known as Rishiri-Fuji due to its appearance. [Rebun](e6877.html) is longer and flatter than Rishiri and most famous for its wealth of alpine flowers found at sea level due to the harsh local climate.
