Takeda Shrine (武田神社, Takeda Jinja) is a [shrine](e2059.html) in [Kofu](e6950.html), built on the former grounds of the residence of local hero Takeda Shingen, one of the strongest feudal warlords in [Japanese history](e641.html). As well as features typical to a shrine, such as a main hall, prayer hall and multiple torii gates, ruined elements of the old residence can still be viewed, including some stone walls and a moat that protected the former residence.

The Takeda clan was based in Kofu for many generations and controlled today's [Yamanashi Prefecture](/list/e1217.html). Takeda Shingen expanded the clan's territories to include large parts of today's [Nagano Prefecture](/list/e1216.html) and other areas. Shingen was one of the most powerful lords during the [era of warring states](e2134.html) but died just before a deciding battle with [Oda Nobunaga](e2123.html) who later defeated the Takeda and ultimately emerged as the unifier of the country.

In addition to a nice main hall and prayer hall, the [shrine](e2059.html)'s verdant grounds contain a [Noh](e2091.html) stage and a network of paths that lead around the complex. There is also a treasure house in which a variety of exhibits pertaining to Takeda Shingen are exhibited, including old battle strategy diagrams, weapons, tools and items of clothing used by him.

As a result of his great achievements Takeda Shingen is fondly remembered by the people of [Yamanashi](/list/e1217.html), and there are various other Shingen-related sites across [Kofu](e6950.html) including a statue of him that stands prominently on the south side of Kofu Station.
