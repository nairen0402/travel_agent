Nijo Jinya (二条陣屋, Nijō Jinya) is a former inn used by feudal lords (daimyo) who were visiting [Kyoto](e2158.html) during the [feudal ages](e2128.html). In order to guarantee the safety of the important guests, the building has been equipped with secret pathways, trap doors, hidden escape routes and various other security gadgets.

Tours of the intriguing house are held only in [Japanese](e621.html). If you do not understand Japanese, you are asked to bring a Japanese speaking friend or guide (see [link below](#section_links) for a list of volunteer interpreters).

Nijo Jinya stands in the middle of a residential area near [Nijo Castle](e3918.html). It is shown on the English map distributed by the Kyoto Tourist Offices. The closest subway station is "Nijojo-mae Station" on the Tozai Line.
