Showa Shinzan (昭和新山, Shōwa Shinzan) is one of Japan's youngest mountains.

Accompanied by [earthquakes](e2116.html), the mountain suddenly rose from a flat wheat field to its current height of 290 meters between 1943 and 1945. The mountain was named "Showa New Mountain" according to the contemporary reign of [Emperor Showa](e2135.html) (1926-1989).

Still venting sulfurous fumes today, Showa Shinzan stands directly next to Mount Usu, which bears responsibility for the new mountain's birth. You can get good views of the young volcano by taking the [Usuzan Ropeway](e6726.html).

Showa Shinzan stands next to the lower station of the [Usuzan Ropeway](e6726.html). From [Toyako Onsen](e6729.html), it can be reached in 10 minutes by [car](e2024.html) or [taxi](e2021.html) (about 2500 yen one way) or in 15 minutes by [bus](e2015.html) from Toyako Onsen (15 minutes, 400 yen one way, almost hourly). Some of the buses run all the way between Toya Station and Showa Shinzan (35 minutes, 700 yen one way).
