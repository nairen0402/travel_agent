The Mount Fuji World Heritage Center, Shizuoka (静岡県富士山世界遺産センター, Shizuoka-ken Fujisan Sekiisan Center) is a museum in [Fujinomiya](e6365.html) dedicated to [Mount Fuji](e2172.html). Opened in 2017 to commemorate the mountain's designation as a [UNESCO World Heritage Site](e2251.html) four years prior, the center boasts a viewing deck and a variety of exhibitions pertaining to the [volcano](e2327.html)'s seismology, history and cultural significance. The building has an inverted conical form that reflects in the pond outside to reveal the shape of the iconic mountain.

Inside the museum visitors traverse a 200 meter long, sloped walkway that corkscrews up through and around the floors of the building. On the top floor is the Observation Hall, a sleek area with an open-air deck where visitors are afforded spectacular views of Mount Fuji. Within the center are also interesting features including time lapses and interactive exhibits that reveal how Fujisan was formed and the way humans have interacted with it through the ages. There is also a movie theater showing footage of the mountain in different seasons.
