Fukuoka (福岡) is [Kyushu](/list/e1108.html)'s largest and one of Japan's ten most populated [cities](/list/e1003.html). Because of its closeness to the Asian mainland (closer to Seoul than to [Tokyo](e2164.html)), Fukuoka has been an important harbor city for many centuries and was chosen by the Mongol invasion forces as their landing point in the [13th century](e2133.html).

Today's Fukuoka is the product of the fusion of two cities in the year [1889](e2130.html), when the port city of Hakata and the former [castle town](e2296.html) of Fukuoka were merged into one city called Fukuoka. Hakata remains the name of one of Fukuoka's central districts and of the main [railway](e2019.html) station.
