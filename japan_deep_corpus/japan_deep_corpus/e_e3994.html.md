Motoise Kono Shrine (元伊勢籠神社, Motoise Kono Jinja) stands near the northern end of the [Amanohashidate Sandbar](e3992.html). Historically the most important shrine of the Tango Region in northern [Kyoto Prefecture](/list/e1226.html), it once enshrined [Shinto](e2056.html)'s most venerated deity, the Sun Goddess (Amaterasu); and Toyoukehime, a local deity of clothing, food and housing. Both were later enshrined as the main deities of the [Inner](e4300.html) and [Outer Ise Shrines](e4311.html) respectively. As a result, Kono Shrine is also referred to as Motoise (literally: "Origin of Ise").

The shrine's main hall closely resembles that of the [Inner Shrine at Ise](e4300.html), including the ten katsuogi roof logs and the jewel-shaped decorations (suedama) on its railings, not seen at any other shrines besides Motoise Kono Shrine and [Ise Jingu](e4300.html). Next to the main buildings stand several smaller [shrines](e2059.html) built in various architectural styles and dedicated to various deities, including Amaterasu, Sarutahiko, Ebisu, Inari and the Kasuga gods.
