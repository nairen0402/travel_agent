Aomori City (青森) in [Aomori Prefecture](/list/e1202.html) is the northernmost prefectural capital city on Honshu, Japan's main island. This port town used to be the main departure point to [Hokkaido](/list/e1101.html) via [ferry](e2355.html); and, although it remains the main port for car ferries, the opening of the Seikan Undersea Railway Tunnel and the advent of [cheap flights](e2365.html) have reduced ridership and many travelers now bypass the city altogether. Today Aomori is best known for its spectacular [Nebuta Matsuri](e3755.html) summer festival.
