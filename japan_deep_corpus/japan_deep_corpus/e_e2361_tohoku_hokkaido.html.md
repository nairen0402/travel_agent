Below is a simplified map of major train lines that can be used with the pass:

### Validity

1. Unlimited use of trains operated by [JR](e2019.html) in the [Tohoku Region](/list/e1102.html) (Fukushima, Miyagi, Yamagata, Akita, Iwate and Aomori Prefectures) and southern [Hokkaido](/list/e1101.html) (as far as [Sapporo](e2163.html)), including [shinkansen](e2018.html), [limited express](e2016.html#category) trains and local trains. The BRT buses along the [Sanriku Coast](e5025.html) are also covered.
2. There are a small number of JR trains, which partially run on the tracks of different railway companies. When riding along a [non-JR owned section](e2368.html), pass holders will have to pay the fare for the non-JR section on board of the train or at the station. Only the following non-JR train lines can also be used with the JR Tohoku South Hokkaido Rail Pass:
   * All trains by Iwate Ginga Railway and Aoimori Railway between [Morioka](e5050.html) and [Aomori](e3750.html)
   * All trains between [Sendai](e5150.html) and Sendai Airport
3. Seat reservations can be made for free (see details [below](#seat)).
4. The pass is valid on six consecutive calendar days (midnight to midnight).
5. The pass can be purchased and used only by holders of non-Japanese passports, including foreign residents of Japan.

### Points of sale

The JR Tohoku South Hokkaido Rail Pass can be purchased [online](https://www.klook.com/activity/9007-flexible-5-day-jr-tohoku-south-hokkaido-rail-pass/?aid=12675) through various websites, through selected travel agents outside of Japan and at major railway stations and airports in the area covered. If purchasing the pass outside of Japan or via the internet, the actual pass has to be picked up at a ticket office of a major station in the area covered before use.

### Seat reservations

Free seat reservations can be made at seat reservation ticket machines and at JR ticket offices.

### Assessment

The JR Tohoku South Hokkaido Rail Pass can be a good value for those making several long-distance trips around southern [Hokkaido](/list/e1101.html) and [Tohoku](/list/e1102.html). Note, however, that it is more expensive than, for example, a regular one way ticket between [Sendai](e5150.html) and [Sapporo](e2163.html), so considerable use of trains is needed for it to pay off. Travelers starting and/or ending their trip in [Tokyo](e2164.html) could consider the similar [JR East South Hokkaido Rail Pass](e2361_southhokkaido.html) which additionally covers the [Kanto Region](/list/e1103.html) around Tokyo.
