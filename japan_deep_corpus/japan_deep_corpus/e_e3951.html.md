  Early April

  Between Ginkakuji and Nanzenji Temples, admission free

  The [Philosopher's Path](e3906.html) is a pleasant path besides a canal that connects [Ginkakuji](e3907.html) (Silver Pavilion) with the vicinity of [Nanzenji](e3905.html). It is lined by hundreds of cherry trees.
* 

  [Maruyama Park••](e3925.html)

* 

  [Arashiyama••](e3912.html)

  Early April

  Northwest of central Kyoto, admission free

  [Arashiyama](e3912.html) is a pleasant and busy district in the outskirts of Kyoto. Many cherry trees can be found around the Togetsukyo Bridge at the foot of Arashiyama mountains, especially in the riverside Nakanoshima Park. Another nice hanami spot in the area is [Daikakuji Temple](e3964.html) whose large pond is surrounded by cherry trees.
* 

  [Heian Shrine••](e3904.html)

  Mid April

  Garden: 8:30 to 17:30 (until 17:00 before March 15), 600 yen

  Large numbers of weeping cherry trees (yaebeni shidare) stand in the garden of [Heian Shrine](e3904.html), behind the shrine's main buildings, making it one of the best spots to see weeping cherry trees in Kyoto. The trees reach full bloom a few days after the other cherry trees, making it an ideal spot for visitors who miss the main season by a few days.
* 

  Haradani-en Garden••

  Mid April

  North of central Kyoto; 9:00 to 17:00; the admission fee depends on the state of the season (up to 1800 yen), 2025: open from 3/22

  Open only seasonally, Haradani-en is another excellent spot to enjoy large numbers of later blooming weeping cherry trees. The pleasant garden is located in the northern outskirts of Kyoto in the hills above [Kinkakuji Temple](e3908.html). It is a little bit difficult to reach by public transportation by the infrequent bus number M1 from Kitaoji Station or Kinkakuji-michi, but a shuttle bus is operated during the peak of the season (from March 29, 2025) from around the entrance of the Wara Tenjin Shrine. Many visitors also access the garden by [taxi](e2021.html).
* 

  Okazaki Canal•

  Early April

  Outside Heian Shrine, admission free  
  Cruises 2025: 3/20 to 4/13, 9:30 to 16:30, 2000 yen

  Located just outside of [Heian Shrine](e3904.html), Okazaki Canal connects the Lake Biwa Canal network with Kamo River. It is lined by many cherry trees, and popular 25 minute long boat tours are conducted during the hanami season. Evening illuminations are held during the peak of the season.
* 

  Keage Incline•

  Early April

  Adjacent to Okazaki Canal near Nanzenji Temple, admission free

  Part of a canal system that connects Kyoto with Lake Biwa on the other side of the mountains, the Keage Incline was used until the 1950s to transport boats between Okazaki Canal and the canals higher up. Today, the gentle slope is lined by about a hundred cherry trees.
* 

  [Daigoji Temple•](e3916.html)

  Early April

  15 minute walk from Daigoji Station, 9:00 to 17:00, 1500 yen

  [Daigoji](e3916.html) is a temple complex with many cherry trees southeast of central Kyoto, where [Hideyoshi](e2123.html) held a famous hanami party in the 16th century. Some outstanding weeping cherry trees stand on the grounds of the Reihokan Museum and in front of the Sanboin.
* 

  [Nijo Castle•](e3918.html)

  Late March to mid April

  A few steps from Nijojo-mae Station (Tozai Subway Line)  
  Admission: 8:45 to 17:00, 800 yen  
  Illumination 2025: 3/14 to 4/13, 18:00 to 22:00 (entry until 21:00), 1600-2800 yen depending on the date and purchase method (advance vs. more expensive on-site purchase)

  Many cherry tree [varieties](e2011_species.html) on [Nijo Castle](e3918.html)'s spacious grounds result in a long blooming season during most of March and April. Yet, because at any time there are always some trees out of bloom, the overall experience may not be as overwhelming as in hanami spots where all the trees bloom at the same time. Illuminations are held in the evenings.
* 

  Kyoto Botanical Garden•

  Early April

  A few steps from Kitayama Station (Karasuma Subway Line)  
  Admission: 9:00 to 17:00 (entry until 16:00), 500 yen  
  Illumination 2025: 3/25 to 4/6, until 21:00 (entry until 20:00)

  Besides a lot of other flowers and trees, the Kyoto Botanical Garden contains a beautiful grove of weeping cherry trees and [Somei Yoshino](e2011_species.html) that is popular for picnics. Furthermore, a majestic weeping cherry stands next to the large lawn area in the center of the garden.
* 

  [Kiyomizudera](e3901.html)

  Early April

  15 minute walk from Kiyomizu-michi bus stop, 6:00 to 18:00, 500 yen  
  Illumination 2025: 3/25 to 4/3, 18:00 to 21:30 (entry until 21:00), 500 yen

  There are quite a few cherry trees planted around the large balcony of [Kiyomizudera](e3901.html), but the largest concentration of trees is located around the pond near the exit of the temple grounds.
* 

  [Ninnaji](e3929.html)

  Early to mid April

  A few steps from Omuro Ninnaji Station (Keifuku Kitano Line)  
  Admission: 9:00 to 17:00, 500 yen (during the cherry blossom season: from 3/22 to 5/6 in 2025)

  [Ninnaji Temple](e3929.html) is well known for its locally cultivated variety of [late blooming cherry trees](e2011_species.html) known as Omuro Cherry. The Omuro cherry trees tend to bloom about a week after the mainstream [Somei Yoshino](e2011_species.html). There are several hundred trees of them located on the temple grounds.
* 

  Kamogawa

  Early April

  Kitaoji Station (Karasuma Subway Line), admission free

  Kamogawa is the river, which runs through central [Kyoto](e2158.html). Cherry trees are planted in many places along the river. One of the most pleasant places for cherry blossom viewing and a picnic is in northern Kyoto, where Kitaoji Street crosses the river.
* 

  Hirano Shrine

  Illumination 2025: 3/22 to 4/13, until 21:00
