Taga Shrine (多賀神社, Taga Jinja) is situated north of [Uwajima](e5575.html)'s city center. People pray at the shrine for longevity, good health and fertility in particular. The [shrine](e2059.html)'s claim to fame among foreign tourists are its fertility-related objects of worship, including an approximately two meter long wooden phallus displayed alongside the main shrine building. Such explicit fertility objects were more common at shrines across Japan in the past until puritanical values from the West led to their removal around the [Meiji Period](e2130.html) (1868-1912).

Next to the shrine hall stands a museum that showcases the shrine's collection of international and domestic pornographic materials. Items on exhibit include adult-oriented illustrations, [ukiyoe](e2291.html) and objects from various regions of the world and eras of history. Minors under the age of 20 are not allowed entry.

Taga Shrine is a 15 minute walk northwest of Uwajima Station.
