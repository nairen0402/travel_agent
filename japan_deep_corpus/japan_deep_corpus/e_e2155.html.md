With over two million inhabitants, Nagoya (名古屋) is Japan's fourth most populated [city](/list/e1003.html) after [Tokyo](e2164.html), [Yokohama](e2156.html) and [Osaka](e2157.html). It is the capital of [Aichi Prefecture](/list/e1221.html) and the principal city of the Nobi plain, one of Honshu's three large plains and metropolitan and industrial centers.

Nagoya developed as the castle town of the Owari, one of the three branches of the ruling Tokugawa family during the [Edo Period](e2128.html) (1603-1868). Much of the city, including most of its historic buildings, were destroyed in the air raids of 1945. The [Toyota Motor Corporation](e3308.html) maintains its headquarters just outside of Nagoya.
