Covered by: [Japan Rail Pass](/e/e2361.html)

[Tokyo](e2164.html) and [Kumamoto](e4500.html) are connected with each other by the [Tokaido, Sanyo and Kyushu Shinkansen](e2018.html). One transfer of trains is required along the way, typically at Shin-Osaka or Hakata Station. The one way trip takes about six hours and costs around 27,000 yen. The [Japan Rail Pass](e2361.html) fully covers the trip if done by the slower [Hikari](e2018_tokaido.html) and [Sakura](e2018_sanyo.html) trains, but a supplement fee is required on the [Nozomi](e2018_sanyo.html) and [Mizuho](e2018_sanyo.html) trains.

Above fees and schedules are subject to change. Be sure to check current yen [exchange rates](e2196.html).

The city's main station, **Kumamoto Station**, is located about two kilometers southwest of the city center. Local trains from [Fukuoka](e2161.html) also stop at **Kami-Kumamoto Station**, one station north of Kumamoto Station. Both stations are about a 10 minute tram ride from the city center.

[Kumamoto](e4503.html) is served by two tram lines and many bus lines. Trams cost a flat 180 yen per ride and provide convenient access from Kumamoto Station and Kami-Kumamoto Station to the city center and most tourist attractions. The local Denden Nimoca IC card, as well as [Suica, Icoca and eight other IC card types](e2359_003.html) can be used on the trams and JR trains in Kumamoto, but not on buses. However, in a highly unfortunate move, the city decided to end accepting the leading IC cards on its trams from April 2026.

Most [city bus](e2015.html) and [highway bus](e2366.html) lines terminate at **Sakuramachi Bus Terminal** in the city center. A one-day pass for unlimited use of trams and city buses in central Kumamoto is available for 800 yen, while a one-day pass for just the trams costs 500 yen. Both passes include discounts on admission to some of Kumamoto's main attractions.

The JR Hohi Line, which connects Kumamoto with [Aso](e4552.html) and [Beppu](e4700.html), can be useful to access eastern parts of Kumamoto City, including [Suizenji Garden](e4502.html), and the airport ([see below](#airport)).

**Kumamoto Airport** is located about 20 kilometers east of central Kumamoto. It can be reached by bus for 1000 yen one way in about 50 minutes from Kumamoto Sakuramachi Bus Terminal or about 60 minutes from Kumamoto Station. Alternatively, take the JR Hohi Line from Kumamoto to Higo-Otsu Station (40 minutes, 560 yen, covered by [JR passes](e2357.html)), from where there are free shuttle buses (15 minutes) to the airport every 30 minutes.
