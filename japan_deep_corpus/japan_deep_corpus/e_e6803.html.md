Lake Kussharo (屈斜路湖, Kussharoko) is a beautiful caldera lake in [Akan Mashu National Park](e6800.html). With a circumference of 57 kilometers it is the park's largest lake. Various outdoor activities, such as fishing, hiking, kayaking and cycling, can be enjoyed around the lake.

A further attraction are several outdoor [hot spring](e2292.html) baths (rotenburo) which are located along the lake's shores and can be used for free and, unlike most other hot spring baths in Japan, in swim suits. Note, however, that some of these baths do not always look very well maintained.

A particularly nice spot to visit is the Wakoto Peninsula at the lake's southern end. The peninsula offers attractive walking trails through the forest, two more [hot spring baths](e2292.html) and some sulfurous vents at its tip.

* 

  Kotan Open Air Bath

  Hours: Always open  
  Admission: Free

  This rustic bath is so close to the lake that it gives bathers the sensation of bathing in the lake itself. Sunsets are supposed to be nice from this bath. The changing facilities are limited, and the men's bath is separated from the women's bath only by a low stone wall.
* 

  Wakoto Peninsula Open Air Bath

  Hours: Always open  
  Admission: Free

  An outdoor bath (rotemburo) on the Wakoto Peninsula offers a nice view of the lake and relative seclusion. However, the water levels are sometimes low and the water dirty, making it somewhat unappealing in appearance. The bath is gender mixed.
* 

  Wakoto Peninsula Indoor Bath

  Hours: Always open  
  Admission: Free

  This small indoor bath is located in a wooden hut along the walking trail that leads around the Wakoto Peninsula. It is pleasantly secluded, but not always well maintained. The bath is gender mixed.

During some weeks in winter (January 24 to March 1, 2026) and summer (July 26 to August 31, 2025), there are infrequent buses from Kawayu Onsen Station to the western shores of Lake Kussharo. During the rest of the year, public transportation around Lake Kussharo is virtually non-existent. The best means of transportation to get around are a [rental car](e2024.html) or a [bicycle](e2210.html).
