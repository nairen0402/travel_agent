[Kochi](e5600.html)'s most famous dish is katsuo no tataki (鰹のタタキ), lightly broiled, sliced bonito (also know as skipjack tuna). It is served alongside spring onions, ginger and garlic and seasoned with salt or [soya sauce](e2045.html) with vinegar and citrus. Traditionally, katsuo no tataki should be broiled over a straw fire until just the outer layer is grilled a little bit.

Katsuo no tataki is a popular dish at [izakaya](e2036_izakaya.html) (casual restaurants for drinking) and restaurants across the city, especially in the [downtown area](e5605.html) around Harimayabashi.

Bonito is also used to make [katsuobushi](e2313.html#katsuobushi), the dried fish flakes used in many [Japanese dishes](e2035.html) as a seasoning or as soup stock. Kochi's katsuobushi is highly regarded for its quality and flavor. Various katsuobushi related products are available at souvenir shops across [Kochi](e5600.html).
