The Fujinomiya 5th Station (富士宮五合目, Fujinomiya Gogōme) is the second most popular and second most developed of the four 5th stations on [Mount Fuji](e2172.html). It is the easiest to access by public transportation from western Japan and is served by direct buses from Shin-Fuji and Mishima stations along the [JR Tokaido Shinkansen](e2018_tokaido.html).

The windy road to the 5th station, called the **Fujisan Skyline**, used to be a toll road, but it is now free to use. However, the road is closed to private vehicles during the official [climbing season](e6901.html) (July 10 to September 10) when shuttle buses instead operate to a designated parking lot further down the mountain and train stations. The road is also closed during winter from late November to late April.

The Fujinomiya Trail around the Fujinomiya 5th Station

Besides a lot of parking spaces, the Fujinomiya 5th Station offers a shop, restaurant and toilets. As with the shops found at the other 5th stations, this is the last chance for climbers to get food, water, oxygen and other supplies at reasonable prices before the costs skyrocket at higher elevations.

At 2400 meters above sea level, the Fujinomiya 5th Station is the highest of the 5th stations, and the **Fujinomiya Trail** is the [shortest route up Mount Fuji](e6901.html). The ascent takes 4-7 hours, while the descent takes 2-6 hours. There are about half a dozen mountain huts along the way. The Fujinomiya Trail is the only route that is not split into separate ascending and descending trails, which can result in congestions on busy days during the climbing season. Note also that the trail does not offer views of the sunrise before reaching the summit.

Besides the trail to the summit, Fujinomiya 5th Station offers a shorter hiking trail to **Hoeizan**, a nearby secondary peak with a crater on the southeastern slope of [Mount Fuji](e2172.html). Hoeizan was formed in 1707 and 1708 during the Hoei Era of the [Edo Period](e2128.html), when Mount Fuji last erupted.

The trail to Hoeizan branches off the Fujinomiya Trail at the 6th station, and it takes about 30 minutes to reach the crater rim from where nice views of Hoeizan's crater and peak can be enjoyed. Hikers can then return to the 5th station via a circular route or continue for another 30-60 minutes through the crater and up to the peak of Hoeizan on the crater's opposite side.

From its 2693 meter high peak, Hoeizan offers an unobstructed, panoramic view down to the Pacific Ocean and as far away as [Tokyo](e2164.html) on a clear day. The return trip down into the crater includes a short "sand run" similar to the Osunabashiri of the [Gotemba Trail](e6929.html) and is considerably faster than the ascent.

### By bus from Shin-Fuji Station (summer only)

During the climbing season, [buses](e2015.html) operate between Shin-Fuji Station and the Fujinomiya 5th Station, making a stop at [Fujinomiya](e6365.html) Station along the way (see [timetable](/bus/fuji_season.html)). From Shin-Fuji Station, the one way trip to the 5th station takes around two hours and costs 2740 yen, while a round trip ticket is available for 4000 yen. Seat reservations are not possible. Shin-Fuji Station is served only by Kodama trains along the [Tokaido Shinkansen](e2018_tokaido.html), which connects [Tokyo](e2164.html) with [Osaka](e2157.html). The shinkansen ride from Tokyo takes an hour and costs around 5500 yen one way.

### By bus from Mishima Station (summer only)

During the climbing season, buses connect the 5th Station to Mishima Station (see [timetable](/bus/fuji_season.html)) along the [Tokaido Shinkansen](e2018_tokaido.html) (40-50 minutes, 4000-4500 yen from Tokyo by Kodama or Hikari). The bus ride takes about 90 minutes and costs 3500 yen one way. [Online seat reservations](https://www.fujikyucitybus.com/highwaybus/fugaku_liner.html) are required in the direction of the 5th Station, but cannot be made in the direction of Mishima Station (when buses are boarded on a first-come first-serve basis).

### By car

The windy, toll-free road to the Fujinomiya 5th Station is closed to private vehicles during the climbing season (July 10 to September 10) and during winter, typically from late November to late April. During the rest of the year, the 5th station can be reached by [car](e2024.html).
