### Assessment

The pass costs a little bit more than [regular tickets](e2359_001.html) for a round trip between Sapporo and Furano, but it is likely to provide some savings over regular train tickets for an excursion from [Sapporo](e2163.html) to the [Furano](e6825.html) region and back, if you visit also [Biei](e6828.html) and [Asahikawa](e6890.html) or if you add a side trip to [Otaru](e6700.html).

### Seat reservations

Free seat reservations can be made at seat reservation ticket machines in Hokkaido and at JR ticket offices. It is also possible to make online seat reservations on the [JR East Train Reservation website](https://www.eki-net.com/en/jreast-train-reservation/Top/Index); however, physical seat reservation tickets have to be picked up at a selected ticket office in Hokkaido before use.

### Alternative tickets

For a simple [round trip between Sapporo and Asahikawa](e6891.html?aFROM=2163_6890), the S-Kippu for limited express trains (6040 yen) or a round trip ticket for [highway buses](e2366.html) (4700 yen) are considerably cheaper than the Sapporo-Furano Area Pass. But note that the S-Kippu is scheduled to be discontinued in March 2026.
