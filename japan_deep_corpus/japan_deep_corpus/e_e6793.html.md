The Kushiro Washo Market (釧路和商市場, Kushiro Washō Ichiba) is a [market](e2452.html) located just a short walk from Kushiro Station. It is ranked as one of the three famous markets of [Hokkaido](/list/e1101.html) alongside [Sapporo](e2163.html)'s [Nijo Market](e5310.html) and [Hakodate](e5350.html)'s [Morning Market](e5353.html).

Stalls in this indoor market sell fresh and processed seafood, meat and [vegetables](e2346.html) as well as souvenirs.
