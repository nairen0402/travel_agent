The Great Buddha of Kamakura (鎌倉大仏, Kamakura Daibutsu) is a bronze statue of [Amida Buddha](e2055.html), which stands on the grounds of Kotokuin Temple. With a height of 11.4 meters, it has long been the second tallest bronze Buddha statue in Japan, surpassed only by the statue in [Nara](e2165.html)'s [Todaiji Temple](e4100.html) and some recent creations.

The statue was cast in 1252 and originally located inside a large [temple](e2058.html) hall. However, the temple buildings were destroyed multiple times by typhoons and a tsunami in the 14th and 15th centuries. So, since the late 15th century, the Buddha has been standing in the open air.

The Great Buddha is located a 5-10 minute walk from Hase Station, the third station from Kamakura along the Enoden railway line. The Enoden is a streetcar-like train that connects Kamakura with Enoshima and Fujisawa. Its terminal station in Kamakura is located just next to JR Kamakura Station.
