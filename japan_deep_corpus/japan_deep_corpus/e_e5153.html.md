Zuihoden, the mausoleum of Date Masamune

Zuihoden (瑞鳳殿, Zuihōden) is the mausoleum of Date Masamune, one of the most powerful feudal lords of the [Edo Period](e2128.html) (1603-1868). Masamune was the first in a long line of Date lords to rule over Sendai from [Aoba Castle](e5152.html). His son and grandson, Date Tadamune and Date Tsunamune, are entombed in nearby mausoleums, while other descendants are laid to rest in less elaborate graves and tombs.

Zuihoden was designed in the ornate style of the [Momoyama Period](e2123.html). It features intricate woodwork and a rich variety of vivid colors. Masamune's son and grandson are entombed in smaller mausoleums designed in the same style.

Massive cedar trees surround the paths in the area and are meant to symbolize the long history of the Date clan. A museum beside the Zuihoden main building shows some of the personal artifacts of the Date family and even some specimens of their bones and hair.

The details of the mausoleum

Zuihoden can be reached in about 15 minutes from Sendai Station by the [Loople Sendai](e5151.html) bus. Get off at bus stop #4. The bus fare is 260 yen per ride or 630 yen for a 1-day pass.
