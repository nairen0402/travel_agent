Izakaya (居酒屋) are casual drinking establishments, similar to tapas bars, where customers order a variety of small dishes of food that can be shared at the table. They are one of the most common [restaurant types](e2036.html) in Japan and a popular spot for friends or coworkers to meet up for a drinking party or to wind down after work. Also a great dining choice for tourists, izakaya are easily found around train stations and entertainment districts, and range from tiny single-counter joints to multi-story chain restaurants.

The menu at an izakaya is made up of a wide variety of Japanese and sometimes international dishes. Common menu items include [sashimi](e2044.html), [yakitori](/r/e102.html), grilled meat and seafood, salads, [pickles](e2349.html), fried foods, regional delicacies, [hot pot dishes](e2315.html), [rice](e2043.html) and noodle dishes. Primarily drinking places, izakaya also offer a wide range of domestic and sometimes imported [alcoholic beverages](e2037.html), including [beer](e2037_beer.html), [sake](e2037_sake.html) and shochu. Most menu items cost a few hundred yen each, and a typical meal will cost between 2000 and 5000 yen per person. Some places also offer all-you-can-drink plans, which start around 2000 yen for a set time of 90-120 minutes.

Menu at a chain izakaya

Many modern izakaya, especially chain restaurants, offer menus that are accompanied by large, colorful pictures and are easy to understand for non-Japanese speakers. English menus are occasionally available, particularly in districts frequented by foreign tourists. More traditional izakaya, however, often have only Japanese menus without pictures which can make a visit rather challenging for those without [Japanese](e621.html) skills.

Izakaya tend to be lively with chatter and may not be suitable for a quiet, romantic dinner. Seating is commonly provided at Western-style tables, a counter, low tables on [tatami](e2007.html) or a combination of the aforementioned. Semi-private compartments or private rooms may also be available. Some izakaya enforce a time limit for how long customers can stay when it gets crowded over the weekends, which is typically two hours.

### Where to find izakaya

Izakaya can be found in large numbers all across Japan, such as around major train stations, entertainment districts, shopping areas and restaurant floors of [department stores](e2072.html). Many izakaya are open only in the evenings. Some popular izakaya districts include:

  [Kabukicho](e3011.html#kabukicho) may be notorious in the [Shinjuku](e3011.html) area because of its red light establishments, but many restaurants and izakaya can also be found there.

### How to enjoy an izakaya

The process varies somewhat between individual establishments; however, below are some common aspects of dining at an izakaya that visitors are likely to encounter:

* 

  Shoe lockers

  At some izakaya, diners are required to remove their shoes at the entrance or near their table. If there are shoe lockers by the entrance, remove your shoes and place them into your locker of choice. Do not forget to take the wooden "key" with you to your seat. When shoes are removed near your table, they are usually placed under a ledge near your seats or in a shoe cabinet nearby.
* 

  Being Seated

  Once seated, the staff will provide oshibori (moist refreshment towels) and serve a small appetizer known as otoshi, which is typically provided in lieu of a seating charge and costs a few hundred yen per person. The staff may then proceed to ask if you are ready to order. Many diners start by ordering a round of beer (or non-alcoholic drinks for non-drinkers) before ordering food.
* 

  Call button

  Some izakaya have a call button on the table to get the staff's attention to place an order. However, more traditional izakaya do not have these buttons.
* 

  Ordering

  There is no need to order everything at one go, and it is customary to place multiple orders as the evening proceeds. Food is usually served as it is prepared, and some dishes may arrive faster than others. There is no rule to follow when it comes to ordering food, but many diners traditionally conclude the meal with a [rice](e2043.html) or noodle dish.
* 

  Toilets

  [Toilets](e2003.html) in the izakaya are usually labeled keshoshitsu (化粧室), tearai (手洗い) or toire (トイレ). A pair of [toilet slippers](e2003.html) is often found for use inside the washroom. These toilet slippers should not be removed from the washroom, a common faux pas.
* 

  Paying

  Izakaya often leave a running tab of the bill or some sort of token at the table. When ready to leave, take the token or the bill and go to the cash register near the exit to pay. At smaller or more traditional izakaya the tab might be kept with the staff, and they will tally your bill when you are ready to pay.
