Katori Jingu (香取神宮, Katori Jingū) is a popular [Shinto](e2056.html) [shrine](e2059.html) outside of [Sawara](e6406.html), northeast of [Narita](e6400.html). It is the head shrine of several hundred Katori shrines found across Japan. It is dedicated to Futsunushi no Mikoto, the protector of military men, and has been a popular and important shrine since ancient times.

The shrine has a stone lantern lined approach that begins after some shops and restaurants found around the shrine's parking lot. Katori Jingu's oldest standing structures are its black painted main building and vermilion gate, which date from the year 1700.
