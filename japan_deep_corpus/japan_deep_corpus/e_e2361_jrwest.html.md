On three popular [train](e2019.html) lines in western Japan, JR West is offering overseas tourists discounted one-way tickets, which are typically about 15-30 percent cheaper than regular tickets. Specifically, the one-way tickets are offered on the Haruka Limited Express to/from [Osaka](e2157.html)'s [Kansai Airport](e2033.html), along the [Sanyo Shinkansen](e2018_sanyo.html), which connects [Osaka](e2157.html) with [Hiroshima](e2160.html) and [Fukuoka](e2161.html), and along the Thunderbird Limited Express trains and [Hokuriku Shinkansen](e2018_nagano.html) between [Osaka](e2157.html), [Kyoto](e2158.html) and [Kanazawa](e2167.html).

### Eligibility

The one-way tickets can be used only by foreign [temporary visitors](e2221.html) to Japan. A passport has to be presented at the time of exchange. They cannot be used by residents of Japan.

### Points of sale

The one-way tickets can be purchased online through various websites and at selected travel agents outside of Japan.

Only the Haruka One-way Ticket can currently be purchased also via the [official JR West website](https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/), in which case ticket holders have the possibility of making online seat reservations before arriving in Japan (but note that advance reservations are not recommended for trains departing the airport, because it is unknown how much time is needed to get through immigration and customs, and trains rarely book out). Those not purchasing their ticket on the official website can make seat reservations after retrieving their actual tickets in Japan.

If purchasing the ticket through the official website, a travel date within a 1-month period needs to be specified at the time of purchase. If purchasing through other channels, you will receive a QR code, with which the actual pass can be picked up in Japan within a 3-month period of purchase. At the time of the pick-up, you then select your travel date, which can be any date within a 1-month period.

The one-way tickets are a great deal for overseas travelers making journeys along the sections covered, as they offer an easy discount not available to residents of Japan.

### Alternative tickets

A number of [regional rail passes](e2357.html) are available for western Japan. Haruka users to/from [Kansai Airport](e2033.html) may be interested in the [Kansai Area Pass](e2361_03.html) and Thunderbird users in the direction of [Kanazawa](e2167.html) and [Toyama](e7500.html) in the [Kansai Hokuriku Area Pass](e2361_kansai_hokuriku.html). For travel along the [Sanyo Shinkansen](e2018_sanyo.html), the [Kansai Wide Area Pass](e2361_08.html), [Kansai Hiroshima Area Pass](e2361_kansai_hiroshima.html) and [Sanyo Sanin Area Pass](e2361_sanyo_sanin.html) can provide savings and convenience.
