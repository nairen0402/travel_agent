Completed in 1999, the JR Central Towers rise elegantly above Nagoya Station: the 245 meter tall Office Tower and the slightly shorter and slimmer Hotel Tower. The neighboring [Midland Square](e3311.html) surpassed the JR Central Towers as [Nagoya](e2155.html)'s tallest building in 2007.

The building's lower floors are shared between the two towers and house a Takashimaya [department store](e2072.html), the Tower Plaza shopping mall and JR Nagoya Station. True to their names, the Hotel Tower houses the [Nagoya Marriott Associa Hotel](https://www.booking.com/hotel/jp/nagoya-marriott-associa.html?aid=371183), while the Office Tower provides 30 floors of office space. Formerly an observation deck, the top floor of the Office Tower is now featuring a cafe, wine lounge, beauty salon and health spa with great views over the city. Likewise, the Hotel Tower offers a lounge and restaurant with nice views on its top floor.

Connected to the JR Central Towers is the JR Gate Tower which opened in 2017. The building contains the [Nagoya JR Gate Tower Hotel](https://www.booking.com/hotel/jp/nagoya-jr-gate-tower.html?aid=371183), an extension of the Takashimaya department store, Uniqlo, BIC Camera electronics store, and office space on the top floors.
