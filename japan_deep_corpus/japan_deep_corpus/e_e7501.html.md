Above fees and schedules are subject to change. Be sure to check current yen [exchange rates](e2196.html).

[Toyama City](e7500.html) is a modestly sized city with **Toyama Station** as its transport hub. The station is served not only by the [shinkansen](e2018.html), but also by several other train lines, trams and buses. Toyama's downtown area is relatively compact, with many of the main attractions such as the [castle](e7502.html) and the [glass art museum](e7503.html) situated south of Toyama Station. The city is walkable for strong walkers; others will find the tram network convenient for getting around the city.

The **tram network** consists of six lines which all depart from or pass through Toyama Station. The fare is 210 yen per ride. [Major IC cards such as Suica, Pasmo and Icoca](e2359_003.html) can be used on trams in Toyama. There are also two local IC cards, ecomyca and passca, which are worth mentioning because they can be used to ride the trams for only 190 yen per ride. This discounted fare does not apply when using other IC cards.

**Toyama Airport** is located about five kilometers south of the city center and connected to Toyama Station by [bus](e2015.html) (25 minutes, 420 yen one way). The bus also stops at the [castle park](e7502.html) along the way.
