Main Hall

Zojoji Temple (増上寺, Zōjōji) is the head [temple](e2058.html) of the Jodo sect of [Japanese Buddhism](e2055.html) in the [Kanto Region](/list/e1103.html). Standing next to [Tokyo Tower](e3009.html), the temple grounds consist of some impressive structures as well as a mausoleum of the [Tokugawa](e2128.html) family and a small museum.

Most of Zojoji's current buildings are recent reconstructions except for the main gate, the Sangedatsumon, which has survived many fires, earthquakes and wars and dates from 1622.

Sangedatsumon Gate

The temple was originally built in the year 1393 and moved to its present location in 1598 by [Tokugawa Ieyasu](e2128.html) who selected it as his family temple. The mausoleum of the family is located at the back of the complex and contains the tombs of six of the Tokugawa shogun.

The small museum in the basement of the temple's main hall focuses primarily on the previous manifestation of the Tokugawa Mausoleum, which included ornate buildings before it was severely damaged during World War 2. In addition to documents, the museum includes a video about the mausoleum's construction and a 1:10 scale model of the former buildings.
