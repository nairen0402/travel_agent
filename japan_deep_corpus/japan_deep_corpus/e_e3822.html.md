A single day in [Nikko](e3800.html) is enough to cover the town's most famous shrines and temple; however, in order to also explore the natural beauty of the [Okunikko](e3818.html) region, it is recommended to spend at least two days in the area. Nikko can also be easily combined with nearby [Kinugawa Onsen](e3875.html) which offers [hot springs](e2292.html) and a few [theme parks](e2067.html).
