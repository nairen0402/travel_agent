Tsuwano (津和野) is a town at the western edge of [Shimane Prefecture](/list/e1237.html). The town is surrounded by hills and has a placid, pleasant atmosphere.

In the town center, old [samurai](e2127.html) mansions with white earthen walls, dark red roof tiles and wooden grated windows line the streets, portraying scenes reminiscent of past centuries. The waterway which flows by the main street is filled with lively carps, which add color and vibrance to the picturesque surroundings. Tsuwano is also home to the [Taikodani Inari Shrine](e5878.html), one of the five greatest [Inari shrines](e2059.html).
