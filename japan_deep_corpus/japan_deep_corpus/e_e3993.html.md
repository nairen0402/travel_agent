Chionji Temple (智恩寺) is a [temple](e2058.html) at the southern entrance of the [Amanohashidate Sandbar](e3992.html). Part of the Rinzai School of [Japanese Zen Buddhism](e2055.html), the temple houses one of Japan's "Three Important Statues of Monju Bosatsu", the Buddhist god of wisdom and intellect. As such, students and other visitors come to the temple to pray for both wisdom and academic and personal success. They purchase special fortunes ([omikuji](e2059.html)) shaped like folding fans, which many people leave hanging from pine trees all around the temple grounds.

Other important structures around the temple are a large entrance gate and a two-story [tahoto style pagoda](e2058.html), which was built in the 1500s and is the oldest structure on the temple grounds. Chionji is also the site of the tomb of Izumi Shikibu, a famous female poet from the [Heian Period](e2132.html) (710-1185).
