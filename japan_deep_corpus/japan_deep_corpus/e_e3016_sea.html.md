Tokyo DisneySea is a fantasy [theme park](e2067.html) in [Tokyo Disney Resort](e3016.html) that is unique to Japan. Inspired by the myths and legends of the sea, Tokyo DisneySea is made up of eight themed ports of call: Mediterranean Harbor, Mysterious Island, Mermaid Lagoon, Arabian Coast, Lost River Delta, Port Discovery, American Waterfront and Fantasy Springs.

While suitable for all ages, Tokyo DisneySea was designed to specifically also appeal to a more grown up audience. The park addresses the Japanese visitors' strong interest in good food by providing a wider selection of table service restaurants than [Tokyo Disneyland](e3016_land.html).

### Themed ports

* 

  Mediterranean Harbor

  Mediterranean Harbor at the park entrance is styled after an Italian port town. Its waterfront features Venice-style canals and gondolas, and its buildings make up the [Tokyo DisneySea Hotel MiraCosta](e3016_hotels.html#miracosta). Large shows with boats and water fountains are held daily in the harbor.
* 

  Mysterious Island

  Mysterious Island is found within the volcano at the heart of the park and is a page from the science fiction writings of Jules Verne. Here you can explore the depths of the ocean aboard one of Captain Nemo's submarines or journey to the center of the earth.
* 

  Mermaid Lagoon

  Mermaid Lagoon allows surface dwellers to enter the undersea world of Ariel and her fishy friends from The Little Mermaid. This whimsical area of the park with its rides and shows is geared toward younger children.
* 

  Arabian Coast

  The Arabian Coast recreates the world of Aladdin and 1001 Arabian Nights. Here you can watch a magic show hosted by Genie, travel with Sinbad as he sets sail for discovery or ride on a 2-storied carousel.
* 

  Lost River Delta

  The Lost River Delta was built among the ruins of an ancient temple pyramid in the Central American jungle. The Indiana Jones Adventure ride explores the bowels of the temple ruins, while the Raging Spirits Roller Coaster rumbles along next door. The port also serves as a stop for the Tokyo DisneySea Transit Steamers which travel between the various parts of the park.

  Port Discovery

  Port Discovery is the marina of the future where visitors can check out the Searider, a simulation ride exploring the marine life with Nemo and Dory, or try out some of the experimental watercraft that travel between the rocks, fountains and whirlpools of the Aquatopia attraction.

  American Waterfront

  The American Waterfront zone is styled after the 20th century harbor towns around New York, New England and Cape Cod. The area features an elevated train, American-styled restaurants and shops, a playhouse and the S.S. Columbia steam liner that houses a restaurant. It is also home to the Tower of Terror ride.

  Opened in 2024, Fantasy Springs is the park's newest port and inspired by the movies Frozen Kingdom, Rapunzel's Forest and Peter Pan's Never Land. It faces the [Tokyo DisneySea Fantasy Springs Hotel](e3016_hotels.html#fantasy).
