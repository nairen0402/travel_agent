Miyazaki (宮崎), capital of [Miyazaki Prefecture](/list/e1245.html), is located on the southeastern coast of [Kyushu](/list/e1108.html) and has one of the warmest climates among cities on the main islands of Japan. It is also near attractions such as [Takachiho](e8050.html) to the north and [Kirishima](e4625.html) to the southwest, which are both important sites of Japanese mythology and beautiful places to enjoy nature.
