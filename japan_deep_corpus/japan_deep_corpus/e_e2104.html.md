Dolls have been manufactured in Japan since the [early days](e2131.html). Today, there exist various types of Japanese dolls. The following is a description of only a few of the most famous ones:

**Daruma dolls** are spherical dolls with a red painted body and a white face, but without pupils. They represent the [Zen](e2055.html) monk Bodhidharma. It is the custom to paint one of the doll's pupils in the beginning of a [new year](e2064.html), make a wish and paint in the second pupil, if the wish comes true.

**Kokeshi dolls** are simply shaped, wooden dolls from [northern Honshu](/list/e1102.html), which originated as souvenirs distributed at [hot spring](e2292.html) resorts during the [Edo Period](e2128.html) (1603-1868). Kokeshi dolls have neither arms nor legs, but a large head and a cylindrical body.

**Hakata dolls** are clay dolls manufactured in [Fukuoka Prefecture](/list/e1242.html) on [Kyushu](/list/e1108.html). They are worked out in great detail and painted beautifully.

Various dolls are used during festivals. Among them are **hina dolls**, which are displayed during the [girl's festival](e2062.html) and **samurai dolls**, which are displayed during the [boy's festival](e2282.html).

**Bunraku** is a traditional Japanese puppet theater. Visit our [bunraku page](e2092.html) for more details.
