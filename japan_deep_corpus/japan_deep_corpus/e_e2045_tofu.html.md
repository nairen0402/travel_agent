Tofu is made of curdled [soy milk](e2045.html), pressed into blocks in a process similar to making cheese. It is a good source of protein and a staple of [Japanese cuisine](e620.html). Tofu is an especially important ingredient in vegetarian [Buddhist](e2055.html) temple cuisine (shojin ryori). On its own, fresh tofu has a delicate taste. It is a versatile food that can be used in a variety of sweet and savory dishes.

Some of the most popular tofu products and dishes are as follows:

### Tofu products

  Soft tofu

  Firm tofu

  Deep fried tofu (aburaage and atsuage)
