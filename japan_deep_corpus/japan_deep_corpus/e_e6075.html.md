The Kiso Valley (木曽路, Kisoji) is located in [Nagano Prefecture](/list/e1216.html), and runs alongside the mountains of the Central Alps. An ancient 70 km trade route called the Kisoji was developed along the valley and served as a very important means of commerce in the area.

The Kisoji became even more important from the beginning of the [Edo Period](e2128.html) (1603-1868), when it was amalgamated with other routes in the formation of the 500 km long Nakasendo. The Nakasendo ("path through mountains") was one of the two main routes that connected [Edo](e2164.html) and [Kyoto](e2158.html). It contrasted with the other principal transportation route of the time, the Tokaido, which ran along the sea shore.

Because of restrictions by the [shogunate](e2128.html), travelers were almost always forced to make their trips on foot. As a result, "post towns" developed every few kilometers to provide travelers with places to rest, eat and find nightly accommodation during their arduous journey.

Along the Kiso Valley, a few post towns, particularly [Magome](e6076.html), [Tsumago](e6077.html) and [Narai](e6080.html), have been preserved to look as they did when they served travelers of the Nakasendo. Visitors are able to enjoy the stone paths and wooden buildings of a bygone era.
