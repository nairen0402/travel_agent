Mount Fuji Shizuoka Airport (富士山静岡空港, Fujisan Shizuoka Kūkō) is a small [airport](e2365.html) that was opened in 2009 to serve the area between [Nagoya](e2155.html)'s [Central Japan Airport](e2431.html) and [Tokyo](e2164.html)'s [Haneda Airport](e2430.html). The airport offers scheduled flights to multiple domestic and nearby Asian destinations, as well as a few charter flights.

The airport is located between [Shizuoka Prefecture](/list/e1218.html)'s two main cities, Hamamatsu and [Shizuoka](e6350.html), and is named after the prefecture's most famous landmark, [Mount Fuji](e2172.html), which is located 80 kilometers away. The airport is conveniently located near the [expressway](e2354.html), while the [Tokaido Shinkansen](e2018_tokaido.html) passes directly below it; however, there are currently no plans to build a new shinkansen station underneath the airport.

Passengers using Fuji Dream Airlines can utilize their free shuttle bus which connects the airport to [Kakegawa](e6340.html) Station, the closest station along the [Tokaido Shinkansen](e2018_tokaido.html).

Several [rental car](e2024.html) outlets are located at the airport. The closest interchange along the [Tomei Expressway](e2354.html) is only five kilometers away.
