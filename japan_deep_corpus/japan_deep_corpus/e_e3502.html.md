Kokoen (好古園, Kōkoen) is a relatively recently constructed [Japanese style garden](e2099.html), which was opened in 1992 on the former site of the feudal lord's west residence (Nishi-Oyashiki). It consists of nine separate, walled gardens designed in various styles of the [Edo Period](e2128.html).

Among the gardens are the garden of the lord's residence which features a pond with a waterfall, a tea garden where visitors can enjoy [green tea](e2041.html), a pine tree garden, a bamboo garden and a flower garden.

Kokoen Garden is next to [Himeji Castle](e3501.html), a short walk west of the castle's main gate (Otemon Gate). From Himeji Station, it can be reached in a 20 minute walk or five minute ride by [bus](e2015.html) (210 yen one way) or [taxi](e2021.html) (about 800 yen one way) along the broad Otemae-dori Street, which leads straight from the station to the castle and garden.
