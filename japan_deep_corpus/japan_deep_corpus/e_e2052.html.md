Japanese keyboard

### Japanese keyboards

Japanese keyboards look very similar to English keyboards with just a few differences. Letters and numbers are mostly arranged in the same way, and English keyboards can be used to input [Japanese text](e621.html).

The most common input method is to enter Japanese words in their romanized writing (for example: "toukyou" for Tokyo). The input will be automatically converted into [hiragana](e2047.html) as you write, and can then be switched to corresponding [kanji](e2046.html) by pressing the space key.

### Japanese on non-Japanese operating systems

Modern operating systems, including Windows and Mac OS, include Japanese language support. As a result, Japanese text on websites and in simple documents should be supported without the need of any aditional software.

In order to set up your computer to handle [Japanese](e621.html) input, access the "Date, Time, Language and Regional Settings" control panel (or similar) in the preference settings of your computer.

Older operating systems, however, do not have built-in Japanese language support and require the installment of a separate Japanese language software for displaying and inputting [Japanese characters](e621.html).
