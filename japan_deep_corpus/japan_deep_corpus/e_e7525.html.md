Takaoka (高岡) is the second largest city in [Toyama Prefecture](/list/e1219.html). It is historically known as a center of metal casting, and this industry still thrives in the city today. Takaoka is also an old [castle](e2296.html) town that lost its castle during the [Edo Period](e2128.html) due to a law that limited the number of castles to one per province. Because of its position on the [Hokuriku Shinkansen](e2018_nagano.html), Takaoka is a popular stop for tourists on their way to see other attractions in the area such as [Gokayama](e5950.html).
