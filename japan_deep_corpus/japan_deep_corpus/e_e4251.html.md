#### By air

ANA operates two [flights](e2365.html) per day between [Tokyo](e2164.html)'s [Haneda Airport](e2430.html) and Noto Airport. Flight duration is about one hour. The regular one way fare is around 25,000 yen, but [discount tickets](e2364.html) are usually available for between 11,000 and 18,000 yen.

Reservations must be made at least one day in advance. Last but not least, [rental car](e2024.html) outlets are also found at the airport.

Above fees and schedules are subject to change. Be sure to check current yen [exchange rates](/e/e2196.html).

The [Noto Peninsula](e4250.html) juts out roughly 100 kilometers from Japan's main island of Honshu into the Sea of Japan. The cities of [Kanazawa](e2167.html), [Toyama](e7500.html) and [Takaoka](e7525.html) are located within 20 kilometers of the peninsula's base.

Public transportation on the Noto Peninsula tends to be infrequent and complicated. Consequently, a **rental car** is the recommended means of getting around, as it allows you to explore the scenic coastlines and towns at your own pace. [Rental car](e2024.html) outlets are located in [Kanazawa](e2167.html), [Toyama](e7500.html), [Takaoka](e7525.html) and [Wakura Onsen](e4256.html), as well as at Noto, Komatsu and Toyama airports.

Japan Railways (JR) operates **trains** as far as [Wakura Onsen](e4256.html), from where the Noto Railway leads further to Anamizu Station halfway up the peninsula. Railway lines, further extending to Wajima and Suzu near the peninsula's tip, were unfortunately discontinued in 2005.

**Buses**, operated by Hokutetsu, serve the rest of the peninsula with a relatively dense network of lines that connects all major tourist attractions. However, [buses](e2015.html) do not run very frequently, and a number of transfers may be required to travel between two places. A map of the most important bus lines is located above, with the approximate number of buses per day written between major bus stops.

Located in the center of the peninsula, **Noto Airport** can be convenient for accessing the Noto Peninsula, but note that it gets served by only two daily round trips from Tokyo's [Haneda Airport](e2430.html).

Another method of exploring the Noto Peninsula is by **bicycle**, although this is recommended only to experienced touring cyclists. Note also that good rental [bicycles](e2210.html) are difficult to find, and it is probably easier to bring your own bicycle to Japan. The peninsula is popular enough as a cycling destination that the "Tour de Noto" attracts hundreds of participants every year.
