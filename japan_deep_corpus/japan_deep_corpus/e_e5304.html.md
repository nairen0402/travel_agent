This botanical garden (北海道大学植物園, Hokkaidō Daigaku Shokubutsuen) close to [Sapporo](e2163.html)'s city center belongs to Hokkaido University and primarily serves a scientific and educational purpose. The garden with its walking trails and lawns, however, is also a pleasant place to take a break or to have a (non-alcoholic) picnic.

Established in [1886](e2130.html), the Botanic Garden preserves a small part of the forest which formerly covered the Ishikari Plain. In addition, there is an alpine garden, a greenhouse and a small [Ainu](e2244.html) museum. During the winter, only the greenhouse is open to the public.

The Botanic Garden is a ten minute walk southwest of Sapporo Station or a five minute walk north of Nishi-Juitchome Station on the Tozai Subway Line.

Address: North 2, West 8
