Mito (水戸) is the capital city of [Ibaraki Prefecture](/list/e1211.html). Today the city is best known for [fermented soybeans](e2045.html) (natto) and for being home to [Kairakuen Garden](e6201.html), one of the three best [landscape gardens](e2099.html) in Japan.

Mito rose to prominence during the [Edo Period](e2128.html) (1603 - 1868), when Tokugawa Ieyasu, the founder of the Tokugawa shogunate, chose the city as the base for one of his three most important family branches, along with [Wakayama](/list/e1229.html) and [Nagoya](e2155.html). Because of this, Mito was a major power base with considerable impact on the politics and intellectual history of the era.
