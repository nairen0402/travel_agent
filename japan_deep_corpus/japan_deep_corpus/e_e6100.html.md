Yamaguchi (山口) is a pleasant and friendly city in [western Honshu](/list/e1106.html) founded by the Ouchi family in the 14th century. It is now the capital of [Yamaguchi Prefecture](/list/e1239.html), a region formerly known as the Nagato (Choshu) and Suo provinces. As the seat of the powerful Ouchi lords, Yamaguchi grew to culturally rival the war torn capital of [Kyoto](e2158.html) during Japan's [age of warring states](e2134.html). As a result, the city became known as the "Kyoto of the West".

The Mori family succeeded the Ouchi as the local feudal lords and made nearby [Hagi](e6150.html) the seat of their rule. The Mori played a leading role in the [Meiji Restoration](e2128.html) (1868), which brought Japan's feudal age to an end. Yamaguchi today has a surprisingly laid back atmosphere, considering its historical prominence. Several eminent places of worship stand in the city, serving to remind of its past cultural distinction.
