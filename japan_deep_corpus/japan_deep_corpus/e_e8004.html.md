Miyazaki Shrine (宮崎神宮, Miyazaki Jingū) is the oldest and most important [shrine](e2059.html) in the city. Dedicated to [Emperor Jimmu](e2135.html), the mythical first emperor of Japan, it is said to have been established over 2600 years ago.

The shrine's buildings, constructed of simple, unpainted cedar, sit in the center of a large, quiet forest. [Festivals](e2063.html) and other events such as horseback archery competitions (yabusame) are held during the year on the wide path under the trees.

The [Miyazaki Prefectural Museum](e8006.html) stands just next to Miyazaki Shrine.

Miyazaki Shrine is a 5-10 minute walk from Miyazaki Jingu Station (3 minutes, 200 yen from Miyazaki Station).
