The Nara National Museum (奈良国立博物館, Nara Kokuritsu Hakubutsukan), located in [Nara Park](e4103.html), is an art museum which primarily displays Japanese [Buddhist](e2055.html) art. Established in 1889, the museum retains its original building and is joined by a new wing that is connected to the original building by an underground passage.

Both wings display the museum's permanent collection, which includes Buddhist statues, paintings, scrolls and ceremonial objects mainly from Japan. The new wing also houses temporary exhibitions, including an annual exhibition every autumn of treasures from [Todaiji Temple](e4100.html). A ticket to the museum gives access to both wings, and English explanations are available throughout the museum.

The Nara National Museum is located in [Nara Park](e4103.html), a 15 minute walk from Kintetsu Nara Station or a 30 minute walk from JR Nara Station. Alternatively, it can be reached by [bus](e2015.html) from either station. Get off at the Himuro Shrine/National Museum bus stop next to the museum.
