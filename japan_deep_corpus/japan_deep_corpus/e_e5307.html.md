Shiroi Koibito Park

Shiroi Koibito Park (白い恋人パーク) is a theme park by Ishiya, a local chocolate company. The company's flagship product and one of [Hokkaido](/list/e1101.html)'s most famous souvenirs is the Shiroi Koibito cookie, which consists of two thin butter cookies and a layer of white chocolate in between.

The park consists of a **free area** with a shop, cafe and restaurant and a **paid area** with various chocolate-related exhibits and, most interestingly, a few large windows through which visitors can observe the cookie production process in the factory. It is also possible to create your own cookies in hands-on workshops. Another part of the Shiroi Koibito Park is a [soccer](e2083.html) field that serves as the practice ground for Consadole Sapporo, the local professional [soccer](e2083.html) team.
