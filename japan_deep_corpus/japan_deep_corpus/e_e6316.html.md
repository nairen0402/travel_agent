Tokaikan (東海館 ,Tōkaikan) was built in 1928 in central [Ito City](e6307.html) on the [Izu Peninsula](e6310.html) and was further expanded twice in 1938 and 1949. It is one of only few remaining [hot spring](e2292.html) [ryokan](e2029.html) built of wood during the [early Showa Period](e2129.html). Tokaikan operated as a ryokan until 1997 before undergoing restoration works and then reopened in 2001 as a historical and cultural sightseeing spot open to the public.

The three-story building was constructed by master Japanese craftsmen with high quality wood. Visitors can view the ryokan's former guest rooms with their intricate wood carvings. A few rooms exhibit historical artifacts and explain the building's history. There is also a tea room on the first floor where visitors can enjoy tea and sweets and a unique observatory in a tower-like structure accessed from the third floor. The baths of the Tokaikan are open for bathing on weekends and [public holidays](e2062.html) at an additional fee.

Tokaikan is about a seven minute walk from Ito Station. Alternatively, take a [bus](e2015.html) bound for Arai (新井) and get off at Tokaikan-mae (東海館前, 5 minutes, 200 yen one way from Ito Station, 1-2 buses/hour). The bus is covered by the [Ito Izu Kogen 2-Day Pass](e6307.html#section_get_there).
