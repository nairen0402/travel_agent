Saitama (さいたま) is a major city within half an hour by [train](e2019.html) north of [Tokyo](e2164.html). The city was newly formed in 2001 with the merger of Urawa, Omiya and other municipalities.

Saitama is primarily a residential city, and a big proportion of its population of over a million commutes to Tokyo for work. This contributes largely to Omiya Station being a major train hub in the area. The station serves the [Tohoku Shinkansen](e2018_tohoku.html), [Joetsu Shinkansen](e2018_joetsu.html) and many suburban train lines, making it one of the busiest in the [Kanto Region](/list/e1103.html).

Although not known in particular as a tourist destination, the city does have some places of interest such as [The Railway Museum](e6527.html) and the [Omiya Bonsai Village](e6528.html), a leading district in Japan for the promotion and production of [bonsai](e2097.html) (potted miniature plants).
