Gate of the Samurai Residence

This samurai residence in [Aizu-Wakamatsu](e7700.html) (会津武家屋敷, Aizu Bukeyashiki) served as the quarters of the region's most important and highest ranked [samurai](e2127.html), as well as his family, employees and servants. The original complex was burnt down during the Boshin War in 1868, but has since been reconstructed and furnished to replicate its appearance in the [Edo Period](e2128.html).

Because of the high rank of its former inhabitants, this samurai residence is quite expansive. There are dozens of different rooms and sections, including [gardens](e2099.html), guest rooms, a [tea](e2041.html) house, an archery range and a rice mill. Inside many of the rooms there are mannequins portraying typical scenes of daily life and dramatic historical events.

The [Aizu Loop Bus](e7701.html) stops at "Aizu Bukeyashiki-mae" bus stop (35 minutes from Aizu-Wakamatsu Station) just outside the samurai mansion's entrance gate.
