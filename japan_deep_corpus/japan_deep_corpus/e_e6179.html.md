Statue of Kikkawa Hiroyoshi at the Entrance to Kikko Park

After crossing the [Kintaikyo Bridge](e6177.html), visitors are greeted by the statue of the man who initiated the bridge's construction, Kikkawa Hiroyoshi (1621-1679), the third lord of [Iwakuni](e6175.html). In the area behind the statue, there are a number of sites of interest centered around Kikko Park (吉香公園, Kikkō Kōen), a spacious park with walking paths, plants and fountains.

During the [Edo Period](e2128.html) (1603-1868), the residences of the ruling Kikkawa family were located where Kikko Park now stands, and the retainers of the ruling family were located nearby. Because of this, the area is now blessed with former [samurai](e2127.html) residences and museums featuring historic artifacts.
