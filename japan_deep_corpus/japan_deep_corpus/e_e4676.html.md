### How to get to the Satsuma Peninsula

[Kagoshima City](e4600.html) is the main entry point for the [Satsuma Peninsula](e4675.html). The most convenient way to travel to the peninsula is by [rental car](e2024.html), but the JR Ibusuki Makurazaki Line and a number of [bus](e2015.html) lines also provide public transportation options.

Above fees and schedules are subject to change. Be sure to check current yen [exchange rates](/e/e2196.html).

A [rental car](e2024.html) is the most convenient way to get around the [Satsuma Peninsula](e4675.html). The area is quite rural, and public transportation options are generally infrequent. Traveling by rental car is particularly beneficial if travelers plan to visit several of the peninsula's attractions.

The peninsula is served by one [train](e2019.html) line, the JR Ibusuki Makurazaki Line. There are three [limited express](e2016.html) trains per day that travel between Kagoshima Chuo Station and [Ibusuki](e4677.html) in about 50 minutes. Additionally, there are [local](e2016.html) trains bound for Yamakawa Station (one station after Ibusuki) about once every hour. Trains traveling between Ibusuki and the terminal station Makurazaki are much less frequent, operating only every 2-4 hours.

Many of the peninsula's attractions cannot be accessed by train, and require catching a [bus](e2015.html) from either [Kagoshima](e4600.html) or a train station along the JR Ibusuki Makurazaki Line. Some of the attractions are not served by bus either, so travelers without a [rental car](e2024.html) must get a [taxi](e2021.html) from the nearest train station.
