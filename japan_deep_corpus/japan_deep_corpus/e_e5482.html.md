Opened in time for the 2010 [Setouchi Triennale](e5410.html), the Lee Ufan Museum (李禹煥美術館, Ri Ūfan Bijutsukan) features works by the Korean contemporary artist Lee Ufan, who was born in Korea but has been working and teaching in Japan. On display are large installations made of stone, concrete and huge slabs of iron, as well as a number of paintings from earlier in his career.

The museum building was designed by [Ando Tadao](e2111_architects.html), who also created the other museums on the island, namely the nearby [Benesse House](e5478.html) and [Chichu Art Museum](e5477.html). Just like his other works on the island, the Lee Ufan Museum building mixes geometrically shaped reinforced concrete with nature and open spaces that accentuate the artwork displayed within.

There are 1-3 [buses](e2015.html) per hour from Miyanoura Ferry Terminal via Honmura to the Tsutsujiso bus stop at the east gate of the [Benesse House](e5478.html) (10 minutes, 100 yen), from where it is possible to walk (20 minutes) or take a free shuttle bus (5 minutes) to the Lee Ufan Museum. Alternatively, the museum is about a 2.5 kilometer [bicycle](e2210.html) ride (15 minutes) or walk (40-50 minutes) from the ferry terminal.

The Lee Ufan Museum is located between the [Benesse House](e5478.html) and the [Chichu Art Museum](e5477.html) and can be reached from either museum in a five minute walk or two minute free shuttle bus ride.
