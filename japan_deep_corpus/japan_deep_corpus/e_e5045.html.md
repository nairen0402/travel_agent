[Miyako City](e5044.html) is home to a vibrant fishing industry that harvests a large variety of seafood from the waters along the [Sanriku Coast](e5025.html). The Miyako Fish Market (宮古市魚菜市場, Miyako-shi Gyosai Ichiba) is one of the city's [public markets](e2452.html). Due to its inland location, it escaped direct damage by the [2011 Tsunami](e5027.html).

The market is packed tightly with rows of vendors selling all sorts of fish, seafood, [vegetables](e2346.html) and [fruits](e2347.html). Much of the seafood is freshly brought in from Miyako Port, and includes local specialties such as salmon, crab, abalone, uni and [seaweed](e2310.html), which are sold at very reasonable prices. In addition to the larger stalls, the market reserves one section to local farmer families to directly sell their produce to market visitors.
