### How to get to Arita and Imari

[Fukuoka](e2161.html)'s Hakata Station and Arita Station are connected with each other once per hour by direct JR Midori and JR Huis Ten Bosch [limited express trains](e2016.html). The one way trip takes around 90 minutes, costs about 3500 yen and is fully covered by the [Japan Rail Pass](e2361.html) and the [Kyushu Rail Pass](e2361_05.html).

Note that the limited express trains do not stop at Kami-Arita Station, which is closer to many of the town's attractions than Arita Station. People wishing to travel to Kami-Arita Station should take the limited express train as far as Kohoku (45 minutes) and transfer to a local train to Kami-Arita (35 minutes).

Alternatively, Imari can be approached via the JR Chikuhi Line from [Karatsu](e8375.html) (1 hour, 760 yen one way, one train every 1-3 hours).

Above fees and schedules are subject to change. Be sure to check current yen [exchange rates](/e/e2196.html).

[Arita](e8302.html) is located 15 kilometers inland from the port town of Imari, while [Okawachiyama](e8303.html) is located a short [bus](e2015.html) ride in the mountains just south of [central Imari](e8304.html). Arita Station and Imari Station are connected with each other by the Matsuura Railway (25 minutes, 550 yen one way, not covered by JR passes, 1-2 trains/hour), but note that many of Arita's main attractions are located around Kami-Arita Station rather than Arita Station.

When visiting Arita in combination with Okawachiyama, a [rental car](e2024.html) provides a lot of convenience over the infrequent public transportation. Rental car outlets can be found in central Imari and in larger nearby cities such as [Karatsu](e8375.html), Sasebo, Saga and [Nagasaki](e2162.html).
