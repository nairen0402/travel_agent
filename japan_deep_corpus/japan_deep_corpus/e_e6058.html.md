The Matsumoto City Museum of Art (松本市美術館, Matsumoto-shi Bijutsukan) is a [museum](e2428.html) in [Matsumoto](e6050.html) dedicated to the work of artists associated with the city. The museum's main attraction is its collection of works from the world-famous Matsumoto-born artist Kusama Yayoi. Kusama was born in 1929 and is internationally known for her bright and vivid pieces that include one of her most famous works, Pumpkin on [Naoshima Island](e5475.html) in [Kagawa Prefecture](/list/e1233.html).

The collection of the artist's works exhibited at the Matsumoto City Museum of Art include various paintings and sculptures that were created in her typical style. Kusama's work is also exhibited outside the building's main entrance in the form of a large sculpture of tulips that was erected with the museum's founding in 2002. Rotating exhibitions of works by other artists are showcased in a separate section of the museum. There is also a shop selling various souvenirs and goods relating to the art.

The Matsumoto City Museum of Art is around 20 minutes on foot from both [Matsumoto Castle](e6051.html) and Matsumoto Station.
