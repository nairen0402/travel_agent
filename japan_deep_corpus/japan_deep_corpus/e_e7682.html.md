Senkaku Bay (尖閣湾, Senkaku-wan) is a scenic bay on the northwestern coast of [Sado Island](e7675.html). The area is a Quasi National Park, and its steep rocky cliffs and beautiful scenery are said to resemble Hardanger Bay in Norway.

Tourists can view the bay from observation viewpoints in Senkaku Bay Ageshima Park and from sightseeing boat cruises. Cruises by glass bottom boats depart from inside Senkaku Bay Ageshima Park and last about 15 minutes.

Senkaku Bay can be reached in about an hour by [car](e2024.html) from Ryotsu Port via Sawata and Aikawa. Alternatively by [bus](e2015.html), take the Main Line bound for Aikawa from Ryotsu to Aikawa (one hour, 860 yen, 1-2 buses per hour) and transfer to the Kaifu Line to Senkaku Bay (15 minutes, infrequent departures).
