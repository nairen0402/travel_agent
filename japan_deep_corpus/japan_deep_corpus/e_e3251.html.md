### How to get from Tokyo to Kawasaki

Multiple train lines, especially those that run between [Tokyo](e2164.html) and [Yokohama](e2156.html), travel through [Kawasaki](e3250.html), as shown on the map below. The train ride to Kawasaki Station takes about 20 minutes and costs 320 yen from Tokyo Station or about 15 minutes and 230 yen from Yokohama Station.

Above fees and schedules are subject to change. Be sure to check current yen [exchange rates](/e/e2196.html).

[Kawasaki](e3250.html) is served by several train lines that run through the city. Of particular usefulness are the JR Tokaido, JR Keihin-Tohoku and Keikyu Lines that connect Kawasaki Station with [Tokyo](e2164.html) and [Yokohama](e2156.html), the Odakyu Line to [Shinjuku](e3011.html) and the Tokyu Toyoko Line to [Shibuya](e3007.html). All these lines are connected perpendicularly with each other by the JR Nambu Line that runs lengthwise through the city.

Kawasaki's few tourist attractions are spread out around the city. [Kawasaki Daishi](e3254.html) Temple stands a short train ride from Kawasaki Station, but the [Nihon Minkaen](e3253.html) open-air museum and [Fujiko F. Fujio Museum](e3252.html) lie further out into the suburbs.

The [Suica and Pasmo prepaid cards](e2359_003.html), as well as [eight IC cards](e2359_003.html) from other major cities of Japan, can be used on virtually all trains and buses in Kawasaki.
