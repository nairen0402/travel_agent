Otaru (小樽) is a small harbor city, about half an hour northwest of [Sapporo](e2163.html) by [train](e2019.html). Its beautifully preserved [canal area](e6701.html) and interesting [herring mansions](e6703.html) make Otaru a pleasant day trip from Sapporo or a nice stop en route to or from [Niseko](e6720.html) or the Shakotan Peninsula.

From the early days of [Hokkaido](/list/e1101.html)'s colonization in the [late 1800s](e2130.html), Otaru served as a major port. It was hence chosen as the terminal station of Hokkaido's first [railway](e2019.html) line, which connected the port with nearby [Sapporo](e2163.html). Many old warehouses and former office buildings by shipping companies give Otaru's city center a special character reminiscent of past decades.
