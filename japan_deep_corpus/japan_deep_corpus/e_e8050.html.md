Takachiho (高千穂) is a town in northern [Miyazaki Prefecture](/list/e1245.html) that is steeped in Japanese mythology. It is the supposed site of legend where Amaterasu, the [Shinto](e2056.html) Sun Goddess, disturbed by her brother's cruel pranks, hid herself in a cave, prompting the other gods and goddesses to try and lure her out.

It is also the disputed landing place of the god Ninigi no Mikoto, grandson of Amaterasu, who was sent down from heaven to establish the lineage of Japanese emperors, a distinction which it competes for with [Mount Takachiho-no-mine](e4629.html) in [Kirishima National Park](e4625.html).

Takachiho is known as a "power spot", a place of profound religious importance and natural beauty, which radiates spiritual energy. Among the best spots for a spiritual experience are [Amano Iwato Shrine](e8054.html) and [Takachiho Gorge](e8052.html) on a calm day.
