Sendai is the original home of gyutan (牛タン, gyūtan), a dish of thinly sliced beef tongue, cooked over a charcoal grill. Besides the standard version of grilled tongue and [pickled vegetables](e2349.html) seen above, gyutan is also popular in [donburi](e2342.html) form, as a [curry](e2351.html) or in a beef stew.

The dish originated fairly recently in 1948 when a [yakitori](/r/e102.html) restaurant owner in Sendai devoted his business to the preparation of beef tongue dishes. It has grown rapidly in popularity and spread throughout Japan.

Common side dishes of gyutan are oxtail soup and mugi gohan (white [rice](e2043.html) with barley). In its donburi variety, gyutan is served over a bowl of cooked white rice, while the curry gyutan is accompanied by rice as well.

The two most popular gyutan restaurant chains are Rikyu and Kisuke. Both of these chains have branches on Gyutan Dori (gyutan street) on the third floor of Sendai Station. Most of the restaurants of Gyutan Dori open at 10:00, while restaurants in the city typically open for lunch around 11:00. Menus generally range in price from about 1500 to 2500 yen.
