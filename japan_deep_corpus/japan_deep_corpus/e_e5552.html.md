[Uchiko](e5550.html)'s name became synonymous with high quality white wax production in the [late 19th century](e2130.html). At that time, wealthy local merchants built new homes or added to their own, resulting in beautiful streets lined with large, stylish houses dating back to the [Meiji Period](e2130.html) (1868-1912). The Yokaichi district has since been restored to preserve these buildings.

Yokaichi (八日市, Yōkaichi) is comprised of about 90 buildings along a single street. Two of these buildings are open to the public as museums, the largest and most impressive of which is the [Kamihaga Residence](e5553.html).
