Below is a simplified map of train lines that can be used with the Hokuriku Arch Pass:

### Validity

1. Unlimited use of [JR](e2019.html) trains between [Tokyo](e2164.html) and [Osaka](e2157.html) via the [Hokuriku Shinkansen](e2018_nagano.html). The pass is also valid on JR trains in central Osaka and central Tokyo, including JR trains to Tokyo's [Narita Airport](e2027.html) and Osaka's [Kansai Airport](e2033.html) and the Tokyo Monorail to Tokyo's [Haneda Airport](e2430.html).
2. In the designated area, you can use all types of JR trains, including the [Hokuriku Shinkansen](e2018_nagano.html) (but not the [Tokaido/Sanyo Shinkansen](e2018_tokaido.html)), [limited express](e2016.html) trains and local trains.
3. There are a small number of JR trains, which partially run on the tracks of different railway companies. When riding along a [non-JR owned section](e2368.html), pass holders will have to pay the fare for the non-JR section on board of the train or at the station. Only the following non-JR train lines can also be used with the Hokuriku Arch Pass:
   * IR Ishikawa Railway between [Kanazawa](e2167.html) and Tsubata to access the JR Nanao Line
   * Ainokaze Toyama Railway between [Toyama](e7500.html) and [Takaoka](e7525.html)
   * Tokyo Monorail between central Tokyo and [Haneda Airport](e2430.html)
   * Hapi Line Fukui between [Fukui](e6600.html) and Echizen-Hanando to access the JR Kuzuryu Line
4. Seat reservations can be made for free (see details [below](#seat)) except for the [Hayabusa and Komachi](e2018_tohoku.html) trains (between Tokyo and Omiya) which pass holders are allowed to ride only in the non-reserved cars.
5. The pass is valid on seven consecutive days. The validity of the pass is based on calendar days (midnight to midnight) as opposed to 24-hour periods.
6. Pass holders are eligible to various discounts and gifts in the pass' coverage area.
7. Only foreign visitors to Japan (on [temporary visitor](e2221.html) status) can use the Hokuriku Arch Pass. It cannot be used by residents of Japan.

### Points of sale

### Seat reservations

Free seat reservations can be made at ticket offices and selected ticket machines. For trips between Tokyo and Tsuruga (but not beyond Tsuruga), you can also reserve seats through the [JR East Train Reservation](https://www.eki-net.com/en/jreast-train-reservation/Top/Index) website. Furthermore, those who purchased their pass through the [official JR West website](https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/) can also use the JR West website to make seat reservations, but the website is not very easy to use. Note that there is a limit of six reservations to be made at ticket machines, but no limit for reservations to be made at ticket offices.

### Assessment

The Hokuriku Arch Pass can provide a saving for travelers who make a round trip between [Tokyo](e2164.html) and [Kyoto](e2158.html)/[Osaka](e2157.html) via the Hokuriku Region instead of via the more popularly traveled [Tokaido Shinkansen](e2018_tokaido.html); however, it won't usually pay off for a one-way trip between the cities. The Hokuriku Arch Pass is of good value to travelers who intend to explore the Hokuriku Region from Tokyo, as it already almost pays off for a simple round trip between Tokyo and [Kanazawa](e2167.html).
