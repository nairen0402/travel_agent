Pensions are Western-style, family-run [accommodations](e2025.html), usually portraying an elegant image with a personal touch. They are typically found in tourist and [ski resorts](e2262.html) in highlands and mountains, as well as sometimes by the sea and in smaller cities and towns in the countryside. Some locations where pensions are readily found are [Furano](e6825.html), [Niseko](e6720.html), [Nikko](e3800.html), [Nasu](e3840.html), [Zao](e7925.html), [Urabandai](e7752.html) and [Karuizawa](e6030.html).

The charge is typically about 8,000 to 15,000 yen per night and person, inclusive of two Western meals cooked often with seasonal, local ingredients. Rooms are usually simple and furnished with a television set and a heater. Complimentary hot water and some [tea](e2041.html) bags are also often provided.

Guestroom

Most pensions have shared [toilets](e2003.html) and [bathrooms](e2002.html). Towels are provided in the rooms which guests have to take along with them when using the bath. Some basic amenities such as toothbrushes, toothpaste and face soap are also usually available at the communal sink area.

Wireless [internet access](e2279.html) may be available for free, while most pensions at least provide a computer with an internet connection in the common area, where magazines, newspapers and [manga](e2070.html) tend to be provided for browsing.

Many hotel reservation websites, such as [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/?aid=355588), list pensions these days.
