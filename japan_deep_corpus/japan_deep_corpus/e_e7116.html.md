[Ferry](e2355.html) operation between Tokyo and Naha has ceased operation for passengers and is now a cargo-only ferry.

Above fees and schedules are subject to change. Be sure to check current yen [exchange rates](e2196.html).

Naha and the other urban areas of [Okinawa Honto](e7101.html) are served by a relatively good bus network. However, for venturing out of the city, a **rental car** is the recommended means of getting around. [Rental car](e2024.html) outlets can be found at Naha Airport and in major cities. Note that traffic can be heavy in Naha and central Okinawa, especially during the morning and evening rush hours on weekdays. To get from Naha to northern Okinawa, take the [Okinawa Expressway](e2354.html), which extends from Naha to the northern city of Nago (tolls are about 1000 yen one way).

Public transportation on Okinawa Honto is limited to **buses**, with the exception of the Okinawa Monorail in central [Naha](e7102.html). The [bus](e2015.html) network is quite dense, but finding the right connections can be complicated. Furthermore, service can be infrequent on some lines. The main hub of the bus network is the Naha Bus Terminal, but some of the lines can also be boarded at the airport.

Two of the most important bus lines are numbers 111 and 117, which connect Naha Airport and Naha Bus Terminal via the Okinawa Expressway with Nago Bus Terminal in northern Okinawa. Nago Bus Terminal is the hub for accessing the sites of interest in northern Okinawa Honto. While line 111 terminates at Nago, line 117 continues beyond Nago to the [Churaumi Aquarium](e7109.html).

Also of interest to visitors to northern Okinawa are the **Okinawa Airport Shuttle** and the **Yanbaru Express**, two express bus lines that connect Naha Airport and central Naha with the Motobu Peninsula, including the [Churaumi Aquarium](e7109.html). Separate **airport limousine buses** connect Naha Airport with some of the leading resort hotels across the island, including [Manza Beach](e7119.html#manzabeach), [Moon Beach](e7119.html#moonbeach) and [Zampa Beach](e7119.html#zampabeach).

There are also high-speed **ferries** that operate between [Naha](e7102.html) and Toguchi Port on the Motobu Peninsula (some [ferries](e2355.html) stop at Nago along the way). The one way ride takes 75 minutes and cost 1000 yen. The ferries depart from the Tomari Port area of Naha.
