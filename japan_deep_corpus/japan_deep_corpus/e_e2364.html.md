While regular airfares by conventional airlines remain relatively high on [domestic routes](e2365.html), the competition by discount airlines and a wide array of discount offers have made [domestic air travel](e2365.html) in Japan very economical and competitive in recent years. In fact, there are so many discount plans, that only very few travelers are ever paying regular fares.

### Low-cost airlines

Peach Aviation and Jetstar Japan are the leading genuine low-cost carriers in Japan, offering just the bare minimum of services and fares that fluctuate with demand and can be very low:

### Special fares for foreign visitors

### Buy as early as possible

Often the most effective way to get low rates on domestic flights in Japan is to purchase as early in advance as possible. Particularly large discounts are offered when booked at least a month in advance. Many airlines also offer discounts on bookings made seven, three or one day ahead of the travel date.

The biggest discounts are offered on popular routes on which competition is high. Most discounts are available for just a limited number of seats on each flight and may sell out quickly. They are often tied to higher handling fees for ticket modification and cancellation. Some of the discounts are reduced or unavailable during peak travel seasons. Online bookings are possible on each airline's website.

### Avoid peak travel periods

Many of the discount fares are less attractive or unavailable during peak travel periods such as the [New Year](e2276.html) holidays (late December to early January), the spring school holidays (second half of March and early April), [Golden Week](e2282.html) (late April to early May) and the summer holidays (mid July through August, especially [Obon](e2286.html) in mid August). Furthermore, fares on many routes are somewhat higher from Friday to Sunday than during the rest of the week.

### Round-trip discounts

Domestic flights in Japan are priced and sold in one-way sectors rather than round-trips. Nevertheless, many airlines do offer small discounts on round trips. However, because only one type of discount can be applied per flight and other discounts are usually better priced, round-trip discounts are rarely the most attractive choice.

### Early morning and late night flights

Some early morning and late night flights are typically around 10-20 percent cheaper.
