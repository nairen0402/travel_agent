Sefa Utaki (斎場御嶽) is an important sacred site of the indigenous [Okinawan](/list/e1247.html) religion, which - similar to [Shinto](e2056.html) - places emphasis on the worship of nature. The site is located on a forested hillside along the ocean and features several rock formations, which are connected with each other by walking trails. Sefa Utaki is included as one of [Okinawa's World Heritage sites](e7125.html).

Although regarded as a powerful spiritual site beforehand, it was in the early 16th century that Sefa Utaki came into prominence. During this period the Okinawan religion underwent reorganization and centralization under the royal government, and Sefa Utaki became one of the main locations for religious ceremonies and rituals. Reflecting the strong connection between the royal family and the religion, the sites for prayers at Sefa Utaki were named after important places in [Shuri Castle](e7103.html).

The Sangui place of worship

Sefa Utaki is located in the southeast of [Okinawa Honto](e7101.html), about 15 kilometers from [Naha](e7102.html).

### By bus

There are very infrequent direct [buses](e2015.html) number 38 or 338 from Naha Bus Terminal to Sefa Utaki Iriguchi (斎場御嶽入口, 60 minutes, 850 yen), from where the site can be reached in a 5-10 minute walk. For more frequent connections, a transfer of buses is required along the way in Nanjo City.

### By car

By [car](e2024.html), it takes about 45 minutes to reach Sefa Utaki from central [Naha](e7102.html).
