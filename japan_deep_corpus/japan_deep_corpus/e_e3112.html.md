Jufukuji Temple (寿福寺) is the number three of [Kamakura](e2166.html)'s five great Zen temples. It is a branch [temple](e2058.html) of the [Rinzai sect](e2055.html)'s [Kenchoji](e3104.html) school.

Jufukuji was established by the order of [Minamoto Yoritomo](e2133.html)'s wife Masako after her husband had passed away. Its founding priest was none other than Eisai, the man responsible for introducing [Zen Buddhism](e2055.html) into Japan. Besides the often photographed pathway that leads towards the temple, Jufukuji is not regularly open to the public.

Jufukuji is located a ten minute walk north of Kamakura Station, just west of the railway tracks. There is no bus stop nearby.
