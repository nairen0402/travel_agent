Located outside of central [Hiraizumi](e5000.html), Takkoku no Iwaya (達谷窟) is a [temple](e2058.html) constructed partially in the rock face of a cliff. It was built and dedicated to the god of warriors in the [9th century](e2132.html), during the Japanese expansion northwards and the ensuing battles with the indigenous Emishi people.

A small [garden](e2099.html) with pond is located at the base of the cliff, while additional temple halls are located a short walk into the woods to the right of the cliff.

Takkoku no Iwaya stands about six kilometers outside of central [Hiraizumi](e5000.html) and is not served by public transportation. By [bicycle](e2210.html) the temple can be accessed in about 20-40 minutes from Hiraizumi Station, while a [taxi](e2021.html) ride costs around 2500 yen one way.
