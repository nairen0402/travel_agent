Kaga Onsen (加賀温泉) is a collection of four [hot spring](e2292.html) towns south of [Kanazawa](e2167.html), not far from [Mount Hakusan](e4285.html), one of Japan's "three holiest mountains" (alongside [Mount Fuji](e2172.html) and [Mount Tateyama](e7550.html)). The hot springs were discovered over 1300 years ago by monks visiting Hakusan, and have been popular, highly rated [onsen](e2292.html) destinations ever since.

A characteristic of Kaga Onsen's hot spring towns are their [public baths](e2074.html) (soyu), which are found in the center of each town. In the past, when not every [ryokan](e2029.html) had its own baths, staying guests would visit the soyu instead. These communal baths remain popular among visitors and residents alike, and can present tourists with a unique, local bathing experience.
