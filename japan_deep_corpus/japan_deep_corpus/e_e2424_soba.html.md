Soba making (そば打ち, sobauchi) is one of Japan's most widely enjoyed [cultural activities](e2424.html) and is taught at countless locations around the country. An experience of making [soba noodles](e2341.html) usually lasts around 1-3 hours and consists of making the dough with buckwheat flour and water, then kneading, rolling and stretching the dough before cutting it into noodles. The experience often ends with cooking and consuming the noodles.

Many areas across Japan, especially rural areas with soil not ideal for rice cultivation, are famous for soba. But soba making classes are available practically nationwide, especially at craft villages and cultural centers. Lessons are also sometimes hosted in private homes in combination with other traditional crafts to make for a more in-depth cultural experience. Prices of soba making experiences typically range from 2,000 to 10,000 yen per person (usually 2,000-3,000 yen per person per hour).

Prior bookings are often required a few days in advance. Many soba making lessons are conducted in Japanese, but activity websites, such as [Klook](https://www.klook.com/en-US/search/result/?query=soba%20making&aid=12675), also list some English plans. Note that the experience can be slightly messy, so wearing appropriate clothing is advised.
