Naruto (鳴門) is the northeastern most city on [Shikoku Island](/list/e1107.html). Part of [Tokushima Prefecture](/list/e1234.html), Naruto is known for its swirling [whirlpools](e7852.html). These can be seen in the Strait of Naruto underneath the Onaruto Bridge connecting Tokushima to Awaji Island.

Naruto is also the starting point of the Shikoku Pilgrimage, which leads around the island to visit 88 [temples](e2058.html) across Shikoku associated with the famous [Buddhist](e2055.html) monk, Kobo Daishi, the founder of Shingon Buddhism. Naruto's [Ryozenji Temple](e7854.html) is the first temple of the pilgrimage.
