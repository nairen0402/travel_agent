Standing at the far western end of [Miyajima](e3401.html)'s town area, the Miyajima Public Aquarium (宮島水族館, Miyajima Suizokukan) was rebuilt, greatly improved and reopened in August 2011.

The [aquarium](e2425.html) introduces the sea life of the local salt and fresh waters around Miyajima, the [Seto Inland Sea](e5445.html) and seas and oceans around the globe. Among the more original displays is an example of an oyster farm, representing the large numbers of actual farms around the island of Miyajima. Oysters are a [local specialty](e3408.html) of [Hiroshima Prefecture](/list/e1238.html).

Oyster Farm

The aquarium is a ten minute walk from [Itsukushima Shrine](e3450.html) or a twenty minute walk from the ferry pier.
