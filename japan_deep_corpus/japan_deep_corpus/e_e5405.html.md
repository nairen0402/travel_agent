Yashima (屋島, lit. "roof island") is a flat-topped mountain just outside of [Takamatsu](e5400.html)'s city center. It was the site of a famous battle during the [Gempei War](e2132.html) in the 12th century between the Taira and Minamoto clans. Here the Taira were defeated in what was to be the last battle before their final destruction.

Around the flat summit are some attractions related to the former battleground, including a monument to the **Battle of Yashima** and Chinoike ("blood pond"), a pond which is said to have turned red with blood after the victorious Minamoto washed their swords in it.

Yashima offers great views of [Takamatsu](e5400.html) and of the [Seto Inland Sea](e5445.html). Near the many **viewpoints** around the mountaintop are shops where you can buy small clay discs, which are thrown off the mountain for luck. This is meant to symbolize the victorious Minamoto warriors throwing off their headpieces after defeating the Taira.

Near the summit's parking area is **Yashima Temple**, the 84th of the 88 temples on the Shikoku Pilgrimage. In addition to a number of buildings, each seemingly of a different era, the [temple](e2058.html) also has a modern museum which displays artifacts from Yashima's history.

About a five minute walk from Yashima Temple is the **New Yashima Aquarium** (currently closed for renovations until spring 2027). At the base of Yashima lies [Shikoku Mura](e5402.html), an [open air museum](e2421.html) exhibiting traditional houses, bridges and other structures from all over [Shikoku](/list/e1107.html).

The attractions on Yashima are located within walking distance of each other around the mountain's flat summit. Yashima can be reached from central [Takamatsu](e5400.html) by Kotoden or JR.

### By Kotoden

Take a train from Takamatsu-Chikko Station to Kawaramachi Station (5 minutes, frequent departures) and transfer to the Shido Line. Get off at Kotoden Yashima Station (15 minutes, 3 trains/hour). The entire trip takes about 30 minutes and costs 360 yen. From the station, the Yashima Sanjo Shuttle bus runs once per hour to the summit (10 minutes, 200 yen).

### By Japan Railways (JR)

Take a local train from JR Takamatsu Station in the direction of Tokushima to Yashima Station (15 minutes, 280 yen, 1-2 trains/hour). From the station the Yashima Sanjo Shuttle bus runs once per hour to the summit (20 minutes, 200 yen).

### By rental car

A former toll road, the Yashima Skyway, leads to the top of Yashima. It is now free of charge to use and is open from 6:30 to 22:00, but parking costs 300 yen.
