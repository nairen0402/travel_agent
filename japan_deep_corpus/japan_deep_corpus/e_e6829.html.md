Covered by: [Japan Rail Pass](/e/e2361.html)

The journey from [Tokyo](e2164.html) to [Furano](e6825.html) by [trains](e2019.html) involves transfers at Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto, [Sapporo](e2163.html) and Takikawa, takes about 10 hours, costs around 32,000 yen one way and is fully covered by the [Japan Rail Pass](e2361.html).

Above fees and schedules are subject to change. Be sure to check current yen [exchange rates](e2196.html).

Four municipalities, Furano City, Nakafurano Town, Kamifurano Town and Biei Town, make up the area commonly referred to as [Furano and Biei](e6825.html).

Because attractions are spread over the entire region and public transportation is rather poor, a **rental car** is the recommended means for getting around. There are a few [rental car](e2024.html) outlets around Furano Station, and even more of them at Asahikawa Airport and in central [Asahikawa](e6890.html).

Driving around Furano

Alternatively, **cycling** is an attractive way of getting around. Rental [bicycles](e2210.html) are available for typically 200 yen per hour for a regular bicycle and 600 yen per hour for an electrically powered bicycle. Do not underestimate distances. [Furano](e6825.html) and [Biei](e6828.html), for example, are over 30 kilometers apart from each other.

The **JR Furano Line** connects [Furano](e6825.html) with [Biei](e6828.html) and Asahikawa. Trains run roughly once per hour, and the one way trip between Furano and Biei takes about 40 minutes, costs 800 yen and is covered by the [Japan Rail Pass](e2361.html) and [Hokkaido Rail Pass](e2361_01.html).

During summer, the **Furano-Biei Norokko**, a special [train](e2019.html) for tourists, operates along the Furano Line. In 2025, there are three round trips on weekends between June 7 and September 23 and everyday from June 14 to August 11. The train carries nostalgic cars with wide windows and unreserved and reserved seats (all-reserved from August 16 to September 23, 2025). Seat reservations cost a 840 yen supplement, but are free for [JR pass holders](e2357.html). The train stops at the temporarily constructed Lavender-Batake Station, a short walk from [Farm Tomita](e6826.html). Note that the Furano-Biei Norokko will be replaced by a different tourist train from 2026.

Furano-Biei Norokko

The [bus](e2015.html) network around Furano is rather poor, and many sights and flower farms are not served by public transportation, at all. One bus line of general interest is the **Lavender-go bus**, which connects [Asahikawa](e6890.html) Station with Asahikawa Airport, [Biei](e6828.html) and [Furano](e6825.html) every 1-2 hours.

**Sightseeing buses** are numerous around Furano, but a lot of them run only in summer and do not target foreign tourists. Relatively easy to use by foreigners are the following three tourist buses which run during the summer months. They make scheduled stops at popular sightseeing spots, but do not provide tour guides:

* **Biei View Bus**  
  (2025: 6/7 and from 6/14 to 10/13)

  Starting and ending at Biei Station, these buses run twice per day around [Biei](e6828.html). The tours take around three hours and cost 4500 yen (3500 yen in June and October). Reservations can be made [via the internet](https://www.biei-hokkaido.jp/en/bus_ticket/) (until four business days in advance) or at the tourist information office in front of Biei Station until shortly before departure, as long as vacant seats are available.
* **Furano/Biei/Asahikawa Bus Tours**  
  (2025: weekends from 6/7 to 9/23, daily from 6/15 to 8/12)

  Starting in [Furano](e6825.html) or [Asahikawa](e6890.html), these bus tours visit various attractions around Furano and [Biei](e6828.html). The tours last around six hours and cost 6000-8000 yen. Reservations are possible [via the internet](https://www.furanobus.jp/furanopass/ticket) (until one day in advance) or at the tourist information office in front of Furano Station (until just before departure), as long as vacant seats are available.

A variety of tours around Furano and Biei are also offered through [Klook](https://www.klook.com/search/result/?query=furano%20biei&front_id=9).
