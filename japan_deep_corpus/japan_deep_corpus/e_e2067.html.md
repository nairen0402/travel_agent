Japan has a few dozen popular theme parks and amusement parks, including some world-renowned brand names like [Disneyland](e3016_land.html) and [Universal Studios](e4021.html). There are also a few parks unique to Japan, for example, [Nikko Edomura](e3879.html), which is themed after a town of the [samurai era](e2127.html).

During the extravagant years of the bubble economy, many parks were built across Japan, several of which were forced to close again when the economy took a downturn. Those that remain in operation are the bigger and better received ones, usually with unique characters of their own. Below is a list of some of the best theme parks and amusement parks in Japan.
