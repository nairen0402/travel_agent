Oita Airport is located on the peninsula itself and offers direct flights to [Tokyo](e2164.html), [Osaka](e2157.html) and [Nagoya](e2155.html). Buses connect the airport with [Kitsuki](e4725.html), [Usa](e4722.html) and several other destinations in [Oita](/list/e1243.html).

[Kitsuki](e4725.html) and Usa are also located along the JR Nippo Line, which connects Kokura Station in [Kitakyushu](e4875.html) with [Beppu](e4700.html), Oita, [Miyazaki](e8000.html) and [Kagoshima](e4600.html). Both [local](e2016.html) and [limited express](e2016.html) trains stop at Kitsuki and Usa Stations. The [Japan Rail Pass](e2361.html) and [Kyushu Rail Pass](e2361_05.html) are valid along the JR Nippo Line, but the Kyushu Rail Pass is not valid on the [JR Sanyo Shinkansen](e2018_sanyo.html).

[How to get to Beppu](e4705.html)

Approximately one [local](e2016.html) and one [limited express](e2016.html) train run per hour from [Beppu](e4700.html) to Kitsuki and Usa Stations. By local train, it takes about 25 minutes and costs 560 yen to get to [Kitsuki](e4725.html), and 45 minutes and 990 yen to get to Usa. Limited express trains shave 10-15 minutes off the respective traveling times, but cost a few hundred yen more.

[How to get to Fukuoka](e4802.html)

[Limited express](e2016.html) trains make hourly departures from [Fukuoka](e2161.html)'s Hakata Station and also stop at Kokura Station in [Kitakyushu](e4875.html) along the way before stopping in Usa (100 minutes, around 5500 yen one way from Fukuoka) and [Kitsuki](e4725.html) (110 minutes, around 6000 yen one way from Fukuoka).

Above fees and schedules are subject to change. Be sure to check current yen [exchange rates](e2196.html).

The [Kunisaki Peninsula](e4720.html) is set in the rural countryside, covered mostly by forested hills and sparsely populated farmlands. While [Usa](e4722.html) and [Kitsuki](e4725.html) are relatively easily accessible by [train](e2019.html) or [bus](e2015.html), many of the attractions in the peninsula's interior are difficult or impossible to reach by public transportation.

[Rental cars](e2024.html) are therefore highly recommended to get around the area, because they offer convenience and flexibility, and also open up the option of easily visiting some nearby cities such as [Beppu](e4700.html), [Yufuin](e4750.html) and [Usuki](e4740.html). [Car rental](e2024.html) outlets can be found at Oita Airport, in Usa and in Beppu. Alternatively, chartered [taxi](e2021.html) tours and guided bus tours are available to tourists, but service in English may not be available.
