Karuizawa (軽井沢) is an upmarket mountain resort at the foot of the active [volcano](e2327.html) Mount Asama in [Nagano Prefecture](/list/e1216.html). Located at an altitude of roughly 1000 meters, the town provides a pleasant escape from the summer heat. It was promoted as a mountain resort by Western residents of Japan in the [late 1800s](e2130.html), and today many wealthy urbanites own a second home there. Thanks to the [Hokuriku Shinkansen](e2018_nagano.html) it takes just over an hour to reach from [Tokyo](e2164.html).

Various outdoor activities, such as tennis, [hiking](e2427.html), cycling, [golf](e2082.html) in summer and [skiing](e2262.html) and ice skating in winter can be enjoyed in Karuizawa, and there are ample [shopping](e2450.html) opportunities. Karuizawa is located along Japan's [Romantic Road](e7450.html), and it offers nice [autumn colors](e2014.html) typically around mid October to early November each year.
