Koka (甲賀, Kōka, also commonly pronounced Kōga) is a rural city in [Shiga Prefecture](/list/e1224.html), not far from [Kyoto](e2158.html). Together with neighboring [Iga](e4351.html), Koka can be considered the homeland of the [ninja](e2295.html), and it features a couple of ninja-related attractions, which tend to be less touristically developed than those in [Iga](e4350.html).

Since early times, Koka's proximity to [Kyoto](e2158.html), in addition to its rugged terrain, made it a good hiding location for those seeking shelter, such as losing parties of battles. It was from such independently minded, self-governing families that [ninja](e2295.html) and their skills developed. The prominence of [Iga](e4350.html) and Koka ninja rose during the [age of the warring states](e2134.html) (15th and 16th century) when they were hired as mercenaries by various lords for their specialized skills.

The mountains west of central Koka are also home to the [Miho Museum](e7027.html), a unique museum whose interesting structures are blended in with the natural environment.
