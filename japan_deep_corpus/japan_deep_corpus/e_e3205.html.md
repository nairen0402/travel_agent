Sankeien (三溪園) is a spacious Japanese-style [garden](e2099.html) in southern [Yokohama](e2156.html) which exhibits a number of historic buildings from across Japan. There is a pond, small rivers, flowers and wonderful scrolling trails that make you think you are in [Kyoto](e2158.html).

The garden was built by Hara Sankei and opened to the public in 1904. Among the historic buildings exhibited in the park are an elegant daimyo (feudal lord) residence, several [tea](e2096.html) houses and the main hall and three storied pagoda of [Kyoto](e2158.html)'s old Tomyoji Temple.
