Ishiteji's main grounds and its three-storied pagoda

Ishiteji (石手寺), located near [Dogo Onsen](e5502.html) to the northeast of [Matsuyama](e5500.html)'s city center, is the city's most famous [temple](e2058.html). It is number 51 of the 88 temples on the [Shikoku](/list/e1107.html) Pilgrimage. Pilgrims dressed in white are a frequent sight at this large temple.

Ishiteji's name literally means "stone hand temple", referring to a local legend in which an aristocrat had held a stone tightly in his hand at his death bed after seeking the priest [Kobo Daishi](e4901.html) to no avail, and was later reborn with the stone still held in the baby's hand.

Ishiteji's temple approach

A tastefully maintained, sheltered [temple](e2058.html) approach, lined by shops of wooden facades, leads to Ishiteji's temple grounds. The sprawling temple compound boasts multiple temple halls, a three-storied pagoda, various statues and an unique inner temple connected to the main grounds via a cave. New statues and religious objects are still added to the temple.

Ishiteji is known for its Niomon Gate, a designated national treasure. The main hall and pagoda are also designated important cultural properties, and all of these structures exhibit the typical [architecture](e2111.html) style of the [Kamakura Period](e2133.html) (1192-1333). A treasure house displays some of the temple's most important artifacts.

Paintings in the main hall

Of further interest, Ishiteji hosts a curious looking inner temple located beyond a cave behind the main hall. The dimly lit cave is about 200 meters long and is remarkable by itself, branching off in two directions and housing many [Buddhist](e2055.html) statues, carvings and drawings.

Visitors who emerge from the cave and cross a street will arrive at the slightly unkempt inner temple grounds, which feature a large, golden dome-shaped hall. The building and statues here reflect a very different, somewhat peculiar, style than those on the main grounds. In particular, carvings and drawings of the historical Buddha Shaka reduced to the bones, just before he gained enlightenment, leave a deep impression. A huge statue of Kobo Daishi, a celebrated figure in Japanese Buddhism, stands on top of the forested hill above the temple.

Cave leading to inner temple

Ishiteji Temple can be accessed from the [Dogo Onsen](e5502.html) tram stop in a short bus ride (5 minutes, 230 yen by [IC card](e2359_003.html) or 250 yen by cash, frequent departures) or in a 15-20 minute walk. Dogo Onsen is the terminus of three tram lines. It can be reached from JR Matsuyama Station by tram line 5 in 20 minutes or from Matsuyama-shi Station by tram line 3 in 15 minutes.
