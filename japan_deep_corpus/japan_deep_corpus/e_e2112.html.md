An English translation of one of Matsuo Basho's haiku in Hiraizumi

Japanese poetry includes various styles, such as haiku (俳句) and tanka (短歌), and is one of the most widely known forms of [Japanese literature](e2110.html). The first compilation of Japanese poems, the [Manyoshu](#asuka), dates back to the [Nara Period](e2132.html) in the 8th century. It contains about 4500 poems written by royalty and commoners alike.

Poetry remained a popular activity over the centuries, such as during the [Heian Period](e2132.html) (9th to 12th centuries), when composing and reciting poetry at [garden](e2099.html) parties was a pastime with scholars and the nobility. In the [Edo Period](e2128.html), the celebrated poet [Matsuo Basho](#iga) popularized haiku. Later, the [Meiji Period](e2130.html) poet [Masaoka Shiki](#matsuyama) introduced modern forms of haiku and tanka.

The following are a few popular poetry-related sites which travelers can visit across Japan:
