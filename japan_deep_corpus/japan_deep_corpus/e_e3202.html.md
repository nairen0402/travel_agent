The Shinyokohama Ramen Museum (新横浜ラーメン博物館, Shin-Yokohama Ramen Hakubutsukan) is a unique museum about [ramen](e2042.html), a popular [noodle dish](e2035.html#noodle) which was originally introduced from China.

In a gallery on the first floor, the Ramen Museum presents the history of ramen noodles in Japan, including the big success of [instant ramen](e2042.html). It displays the variety of noodles, soups, toppings and bowls used across Japan, and shows how the noodles are made.

On the two basement floors, visitors can explore a 1:1 replica of some streets and houses of Shitamachi, the old town of [Tokyo](e2164.html), of the 1950s, when the popularity of ramen was rapidly increasing. Nine ramen restaurants can be found there, each featuring a ramen dish from a different region of Japan.

For visitors who wish to try multiple ramen dishes, every store offers "mini ramen", a small portion of the feature dish. Tickets for the meals are purchased at [vending machines](e2010.html) in front of each store before entering.

The Ramen Museum is a 5-10 minute walk from Shin-Yokohama Station.
