Susukino at night

Susukino (すすきの) is Japan's largest entertainment district north of [Tokyo](e2164.html). It is packed with stores, bars, [restaurants](e2036.html), [karaoke](e2066.html) shops, [pachinko](e2065.html) parlors and red light establishments. Of special interest to noodle lovers is the **Ramen Yokocho**, a narrow lane lined with shops serving Sapporo's famous [ramen](e2042.html).

In February, Susukino serves as a site of the [Snow Festival](e5311.html), hosting an ice sculpture competition.
