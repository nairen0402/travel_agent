Japan is a shopping paradise with a [wealth of stores](e2450_what.html) selling everything from traditional souvenirs and local food to the latest electronics and hottest fashion brands. Both domestic and foreign brands are represented, as are stores for all budgets, from the [100 yen shops](e2077.html) to high-end fashion boutiques and [department stores](e2072.html).

Large cities, such as [Tokyo](e3053.html) and [Osaka](e4013.html), sport several shopping districts, each with their own unique character, usually grouped around major train stations. Shops are also found in shopping centers, along covered shopping arcades and in extensive underground malls. Outside of the city centers, large big box retailers, [outlet malls](e2451.html) and suburban shopping malls compete for shoppers with lots of variety.
