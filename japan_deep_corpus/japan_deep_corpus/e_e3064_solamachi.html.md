Tokyo Solamachi (lit. "Tokyo Sky Town") is the large shopping, dining and entertainment complex at the base of the [Tokyo Skytree](e3064.html). It features over 300 established and original shops and restaurants, and would be well worth a visit even without Japan's tallest tower on top of it.

Solamachi offers a wide variety of shops that include many unique establishments specialized in goods such as salt from across Japan and the world, food samples and traditional [Tokyo](e2164.html) crafts. An entire floor with souvenir shops offering character goods, interior design and snacks, could be of particular interest to foreign tourists. Of course, there are also official Tokyo Skytree shops.

The complex also houses a large food market, food court and four floors filled with interesting restaurants, including the two top floors of the Skytree East Building that enjoy nice views onto the Skytree. Additional time can be spent at the attractive [Sumida Aquarium](e3064_aquarium.html), the Tenku planetarium (no English provided) and in the multiple small green spaces and terraces found across the complex. Another attraction is the Postal Museum on the ninth floor of Solamachi East with a wide collection of stamps from all over the world, as well as interactive displays and exhibits showing the history of the [postal services](e2224.html) in Japan.

Tokyo Skytree Town

Tokyo Solamachi spans the area between **Tokyo Skytree Station** on the Tobu Isesaki Line (also nicknamed Tokyo Skytree Line), and **Oshiage Station** on the Asakusa Subway Line, Hanzomon Subway Line and Keisei Oshiage Line. Alternatively, it is a 20 minute walk across the Sumida River from [Asakusa](e3004.html).

Tokyo Skytree can also be reached by direct [buses](e2015.html) from [Ueno Station](e3019.html) (30 minutes, 230 yen, every 30-60 minutes), [Tokyo Disney Resort](e3016.html) (45-55 minutes, 800 yen, every 60 minutes) and [Haneda Airport](e2430.html) (50-70 minutes, 1000 yen, every 1-3 hours).
