Kannon-in (観音院) is a [temple](e2058.html) of the Tendai Sect of [Japanese Buddhism](e2055.html). It was constructed on the eastern side of [Tottori City](e8100.html) during the [Edo Period](e2128.html) (1603-1868) by the ruling Ikeda Family.

The temple is best known for its [landscape garden](e2099.html), which consists of a large pond surrounded by lawn and tall maple and pine trees. The pond includes small islands representing a crane and a turtle, symbols of longevity and health, which are commonly found in Japanese gardens. Visitors are served [matcha tea](e2041.html) and [sweets](e2312.html) as they view the garden from the temple building.
