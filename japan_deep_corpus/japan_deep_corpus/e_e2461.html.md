Japan is a long, thin island country with the Pacific Ocean on one side and the Sea of Japan and East China Sea on the other. The length of the country results in an extensive coastline with lots of beaches. It also means that the [climate](e2273.html) and swimming season differ quite a bit from south to north. The best beaches for sunbathing and swimming are found in [Okinawa](/list/e1247.html) to the south, but nice beaches exist in other regions, too.

Beaches often provide basic facilities such as toilets, changing rooms and showers. During the warmer months, swimming, [snorkeling](e2424_snorkeling.html), surfing and sunbathing are popular beach activities. At the more popular beaches, lifeguards are present, and rental shops and temporary beach huts open for business, providing more showers, changing rooms, rest areas, food and drinks.

Crowded beach near Enoshima

Swimmers should be aware that strong currents and poisonous marine life, such as jellyfish, are hazards at some beaches and inform themselves with up-to-date information before entering the water. Beachgoers should also keep the beaches clean and take their [trash](e2222.html) away with them. Many beaches do not provide garbage cans. Certain beaches may have additional rules posted, such as noise restrictions after sunset or - in rare cases - prohibitions on [alcohol](e2037.html). Nudity is generally not allowed in public, and nudist beaches are virtually inexistent.

Below is a selection of some areas where tourists can find beaches in Japan:

### Okinawa and Amami

Subtropical [Okinawa Prefecture](/list/e1247.html) is famous for its white sand beaches, turquoise waters and warm [climate](e2273.html) with temperatures barely falling below 15 degrees in winter and beaches that are open year round. The best time to go swimming is from around late May until October. Always beware of strong currents that can pull you out to sea and poisonous creatures such as Habu Jellyfish, a type of box jellyfish, that are most prevalent from June to October.

  [Okinawa Main Island](e7119.html)

  [Okinawa Main Island](e7101.html) has many white sand beaches, some of which are owned by the large resort hotels located right by the beach. Resort beaches are open to everyone, although some charge for beach access. While most of the beaches are for swimming and sunbathing, others offer [snorkeling](e2424_snorkeling.html) opportunities. See our separate page about [beaches on Okinawa Main Island](e7119.html) for more details.

  [Kerama Islands](e7190.html)

  The [Kerama Islands](e7190.html) are only about 40 kilometers west of the main island of Okinawa and offer white sand beaches and clear blue waters ideal for sunbathing, swimming, [snorkeling](e2424_snorkeling.html) and [diving](e2424_diving.html). Corals and coral reef fish can be seen close to shore, and sea turtles can even be spotted near some beaches.

  [Okinawa Prefecture](/list/e1247.html)

  [Kume Island](e7175.html)

  There are three main beaches on [Kume Island](e7175.html) that offer swimming and [snorkeling](e2424_snorkeling.html) opportunities. Not far away is a seven kilometer long white sand bar known as Hatenohama Beach (shown in image), which can be accessed only by boat tours.

Some offer nice [snorkeling](e2424_snorkeling.html) opportunities. Amami's beaches tend to be less crowded than the ones in [Okinawa](/list/e1247.html). See our separate page about [beaches on Amami Island](e4693.html) for more details.

### Around Tokyo

Despite [Tokyo](e2164.html)'s image as a bustling metropolis, there are [beaches not far from the city](e3076.html). In the summer, beaches along the Shonan Coast and the Miura Peninsula in neighboring [Kanagawa Prefecture](/list/e1215.html) are very popular. The somewhat more distant [Izu Peninsula](e6322.html) is often considered to have the best beaches and [snorkeling](e2424_snorkeling.html) near Tokyo, while the [Boso Peninsula](e6437.html) is particularly popular amongst surfers.

The Izu Island chain south of Tokyo, including [Izu Oshima](e8252.html), offers more beaches. The official swimming season around Tokyo typically lasts from mid July through August, but air and water temperatures are often warm enough before July and into September.

  [Odaiba](e3008.html)

  [Odaiba](e3008.html) has an 800-meter long, man-made beach near the Decks shopping mall with public facilities like showers and toilets. Swimming is not allowed at the beach, and most people go there to enjoy the sun and sand, and participate in activities like beach volleyball. Rainbow Bridge and the skyscrapers of [Tokyo](e2164.html) are visible from the beach, making it a nice spot to see sunsets.
* 

  [Kamakura](e2166.html)

  [Kamakura Beaches](e3109.html)

  The [beaches of Kamakura](e3109.html) are about 20 minutes from Kamakura Station on foot.

### Ogasawara Islands

The [Ogasawara Islands](e8200.html) are a chain of volcanic islands in the Pacific Ocean. The subtropical islands are about 1000 kilometers south of [Tokyo](e2164.html), practically in the middle of nowhere, and are accessible only by a 24 hour ferry ride from Tokyo. But the isolation is a boon for those looking to get away, and the islands offer lots of secluded beaches with [snorkeling](e2424_snorkeling.html) and swimming opportunities. Similar to [Okinawa](/list/e1247.html), the best time to go swimming here is from around June to October when the temperatures consistently top 25 degrees.

* 

  [Ogasawara Islands](e8200.html)

  There are many picturesque white sand beaches on the largest inhabited island, [Chichijima](e8202.html), with clear blue water perfect for swimming, [snorkeling](e2424_snorkeling.html) and sunbathing. Most of the beaches have basic facilities, but some are difficult to get to and have no facilities. The only other inhabited island, [Hahajima](e8203.html), is even more remote and offers even more isolated beaches, mostly without facilities.

### Other beaches along the Pacific Ocean
