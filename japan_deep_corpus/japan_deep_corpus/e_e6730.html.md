The fastest way to access [Lake Toya](e6725.html) from [Tokyo](e2164.html) is by plane via [Sapporo](e2163.html)'s [Shin-Chitose Airport](e2435.html):

2) [How to get from Shin-Chitose Airport to Lake Toya](e6730.html?aFROM=6725_chitose)

Covered by: [Japan Rail Pass](/e/e2361.html)(except bus)

Take the JR [Tohoku](e2018_tohoku.html)/[Hokkaido](e2018_hokkaido.html) Shinkansen from [Tokyo](e2164.html) to Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto (4 hours) and transfer to the Hokuto limited express to Toya Station (2 hours). The entire one way trip costs around 27,000 yen and takes around six hours. It is fully covered by the [Japan Rail Pass](e2361.html) and [JR East South Hokkaido Rail Pass](e2361_southhokkaido.html). Note that seat reservations are mandatory on [Hayabusa](e2018_tohoku.html) trains between Tokyo and Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto and on Hokuto limited express trains.

From Toya Station, [Lake Toya](e6725.html) (Toyako Onsen bus terminal) is reached in a 15 minute [bus](e2015.html) ride (400 yen, about one bus per hour). The buses are operated by Donan Bus and are not covered by the [Japan Rail Pass](e2361.html).

Above fees and schedules are subject to change. Be sure to check current yen [exchange rates](e2196.html).

The lakeside resort of [Toyako Onsen](e6729.html) at the foot of Mount Usu is where you will find most of the area's hotels and shops, a visitor center, the sightseeing boat pier and the bus terminal.

Toyako Onsen bus terminal is served by both the [local buses](e2015.html) to JR Toya Station (15 minutes, 400 yen, every hour, via the [Usuzan West Crater](e6727.html)) and [Usuzan Ropeway](e6726.html) (15 minutes, 400 yen, almost hourly), as well as by long-distance buses to [Sapporo](e5200.html) and other destinations.

Due to the infrequent bus connections inside the park and the absence of a public transport connection to nearby [Lake Shikotsu](e6736.html), a [rental car](e2024.html) is the recommended means of transport for exploring [Shikotsu-Toya National Park](e6735.html).
