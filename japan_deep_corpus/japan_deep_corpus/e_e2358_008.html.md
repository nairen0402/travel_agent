### Validity

#### Round trip

1. One round trip by Odakyu Railway between [Tokyo](e2164.html) and Odawara Station. Odakyu's main station in Tokyo is [Shinjuku Station](e3011.html), but the free pass can also be purchased for use from other Odakyu stations.
2. You may use [local](e2016.html#category) or [express](e2016.html#category) trains; however, if you use a "Romance Car" [limited express](e2016.html#category) train between Shinjuku and Hakone, a seat reservation is required and costs an additional 1200 yen one way (or 1150 yen if using an e-ticket). E-tickets can be purchased on the [e-Romancecar website](https://www.web-odakyu.com/e-romancecar/?language=en), while paper tickets are available at ticket machines and ticket offices of Odakyu stations.
3. Passes purchased inside the free area, e.g. at Odawara Station, do not cover Odakyu trains between Odawara and Shinjuku.

#### Free area

1. Unlimited use of the [Hakone Tozan Railway](e5202.html) (Odawara-Gora), the Souzan Cablecar and [Hakone Ropeway](e5223.html) between Gora to Togendai, the Hakone Sightseeing Boats on [Lake Ashinoko](e5201.html), Hakone Tozan buses and Odakyu buses within the free area and Numazu Tozan Tokai buses between Mishima and Moto-Hakone.

#### Other conditions

1. The pass provides discounted admission to selected attractions in the Hakone area.
2. The free pass is valid on two or three consecutive days, respectively.

### Points of sale

The pass can be purchased as a digital pass for use on a [smartphone](e2223.html) through the [official website](https://odakyu-global.com/passes/hakone-freepass/?utm_source=japan-guide.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=2025_japanguide_hakone-fp) or [Klook](https://www.klook.com/activity/821-hakone-transport-day-pass-tokyo/?aid=12675), or as a paper ticket through ticket machines and offices at Odakyu stations, including Shinjuku Station, and several points inside the free area, including Odawara, Hakone-Yumoto, Gora and Mishima stations.

### Assessment

If you do the [classic round course](e5210.html) from Tokyo by train, cablecar, ropeway, boat and bus, regular tickets would total over 8000 yen, making the pass pay off. However, if you go, for example, from Shinjuku only to Lake Ashinoko and back (about 5000 yen by regular tickets), the purchase of the pass would not be justified.

### Alternative tickets

The [Fuji Hakone Pass](e2358_014.html) is similar to the Hakone Free Pass, but in addition to Hakone, it also covered the [Fuji Five Lake](e6900.html) region.
