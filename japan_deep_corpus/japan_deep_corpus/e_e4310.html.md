The Shima Peninsula (志摩半島, Shima Hantō) is home to Japan's most sacred [Shinto shrines](e2059.html), the [Ise Shrines](e4300.html), and is a popular leisure resort area among the urban population of [Nagoya](e2155.html) and [Osaka](e2157.html). Attractions besides the Ise Shrines include several [theme parks](e2067.html) and [pearl cultivation](e4306.html) along the peninsula's rugged coast.

The peninsula has been designated as Ise-Shima National Park for its natural beauty and cultural importance. It is located in southern [Mie Prefecture](/list/e1225.html) and consists of the cities of [Ise](e4301.html), Toba and Shima and the town of Minami-Ise. The area is also popularly referred to as Ise Shima.
