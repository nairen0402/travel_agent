A chaya (茶屋, lit. teahouse) is an exclusive type of restaurant where guests are entertained by [geisha](e2102.html) who perform song and dance. [Kanazawa](e2167.html) has three well preserved chaya districts, [Higashi Chayagai](e4206.html) (Eastern Chaya District), Nishi Chayagai (Western Chaya District) and Kazuemachi. Each of the three districts has its own charms and mix of shops, cafes and chaya.

The Nishi Chaya District (西茶屋街, Nishi Chayagai) is a compact area just a short walk from the [Ninja Temple](e4205.html). It is much smaller and quieter than the [Higashi Chayagai](e4206.html) and has just one attraction open to the public: a museum, the Nishi Chaya Shiryokan, which displays the history of the district and is a meeting place for free tours of the area (Japanese only).
