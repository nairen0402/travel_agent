Hoto (ほうとう, Hōtō) is a hearty [hot pot](e2315.html) dish local to [Yamanashi Prefecture](/list/e1217.html). It is commonly believed to have been eaten by [Takeda Shingen](e6957.html), the regional warlord during the [era of warring states](e2134.html), and his [samurai](e2127.html) before going into battle. The dish consists of thick wheat noodles in a [miso](e2045.html) based soup and is often served in an iron pot.

While hoto noodles resemble extra thick [udon](/r/e105.html) noodles, they are prepared more like dumplings, and lend a heartier quality to the dish than udon would. The soup is traditionally a miso based broth with pumpkin and other seasonal vegetables added. It can be enjoyed all over the [Fujigoko](e6900.html) region at specialized restaurants, hotels, [ryokan](e2029.html) and other restaurants as well.
