The [Izu Peninsula](e6310.html) in [Shizuoka Prefecture](/list/e1218.html) offers many beaches along its long coastline. The water is generally clearer than at beaches closer to [Tokyo](e2164.html), and it is possible to [snorkel](e2424_snorkeling.html) and spot small fish and corals at some of the beaches.

The official swimming season at Izu beaches is typically from around mid July to late August, but water and weather temperatures allow for beach activities earlier and later than that. Many of the popular beaches are patrolled by lifeguards and have rental shops, food stalls and public toilets nearby. Compared to the beaches closer to [Tokyo](e2164.html), there are fewer rules at the beaches in Izu, but most still prohibit barbecues and camping.

### East Izu

The peninsula's eastern coast is more populated and urban and includes the cities of [Atami](e6317.html) and [Ito](e6307.html). Lifeguards patrol the beaches during the summer beach season, and shops and restaurants can be found near the beaches. Train and bus frequencies are comparatively frequent, and most places are within walking distance from a train station or bus stop.

  Atami Sun Beach

  Ten minute walk from Atami Station

  Atami Sun Beach is an approximately 400 meter long beach close to Atami Station with rental shops along the road and a marina nearby.

* 

  Ito Orange Beach

  Five minute walk from Ito Station

  Approximately 600 meters long, Ito Orange Beach is a relatively popular [beach](e2461.html) with temporary beach huts and rental shops that open for business during the swimming season. There are also plenty of restaurants and convenience stores nearby.

### Around Shimoda

[Shimoda](e6300.html) is a town near the southern tip of the Izu Peninsula. Its train station, Izukyu-Shimoda, is the terminal stop of the Izukyu Railway Line and also a main hub for buses going further down into the peninsula where many nice beaches can be found. One of the Izu Peninsula's most famous beach, [Shirahama Beach](#shirahama) is only a short bus ride away from the train station.

*

Due to their remote location, most of the beaches in the south of the Izu Peninsula tend to be less crowded compared to those around [Atami](e6317.html) and [Shimoda](e6300.html). Bus service is relatively infrequent to the beaches, and travel by [car](e2024.html) is a much more convenient way to get around.
