Okayama (岡山) is the capital of [Okayama Prefecture](/list/e1232.html), and the largest city in the [Chugoku Region](/list/e1106.html) after [Hiroshima](e2160.html). The city is an important transportation hub, being the location where the [Sanyo Shinkansen](e2018.html) meets with the only rail connection to [Shikoku](/list/e1107.html). The city developed as a [castle town](e2296.html) during the [Edo Period](e2128.html) (1603-1868) and became a significant regional power.

Okayama's most famous attraction is [Korakuen Garden](e5701.html), which is ranked as one of the three best [landscape gardens](e2099.html) in Japan, along with [Kanazawa](e2167.html)'s [Kenrokuen](e4200.html) and [Mito](e6200.html)'s [Kairakuen](e6201.html). [Okayama Castle](e5702.html) is located just across from the garden. Okayama serves as the locale for the popular fairy tale of Momotaro (the Peach Boy), so visitors will notice many references to the legendary hero.
