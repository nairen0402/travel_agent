The Mount Fuji Panoramic Ropeway (富士山パノラマロープウェイ) ascends 400 meters from the eastern shore of [Lake Kawaguchiko](e6906.html) to an observation deck near the peak of Mount Tenjo. From the observation deck, which sits more than 1000 meters above sea level, there are panoramic views of the lake below and of [Mount Fuji](e2172.html).

While most visitors take a round trip on the ropeway, there is also a hiking trail from the observation deck down the forested mountain slope which takes about 30 minutes to descend. A different trail leads from the observation point 300 meters uphill to a small shrine at the summit of Mount Tenjo, from there the trail continues on to Mount Mitsutoge, a popular day hike with good views of Mount Fuji.

Views from around the ropeway's upper station

The [Omni Bus Red Line](e6905.html) (Kawaguchiko Line) connects Kawaguchiko Station with the ropeway station (15 minutes). Get off at the Yuransen Ropeway Iriguchi bus stop. It is also possible to walk from Kawaguchiko Station to the ropeway station in about 15-20 minutes.
