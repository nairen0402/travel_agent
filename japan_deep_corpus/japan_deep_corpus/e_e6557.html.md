Hodosan Shrine (寳登山神社, Hodosan Jinja) is an old [shrine](e2059.html) in Nagatoro, a town around ten kilometers north of [Chichibu](e6550.html). The shrine was built at the foot of Mount Hodo in the year [110](e2131.html) and has traditionally been a place where visitors come to pray for protection against natural disasters. The current shrine buildings date back to the early [Meiji Period](e2130.html) and are built in the [Gongen-zukuri](e2111.html) style, in which the [main hall and prayer hall](e2059.html) are connected under one roof.

The buildings here are also heavily adorned with detailed, vibrantly colored carvings. Surrounded by lush forest, the shrine is atmospheric and makes for one of the best places in the area to see [autumn colors](e2014.html). A short walk away from the shrine is the **Hodosan Ropeway**, which takes passengers to the top of Mount Hodo. There are walking trails at the summit with nice views of the surrounding area.
