Covered by: [Japan Rail Pass](/e/e2361.html)

[Tokyo](e2164.html) (Tokyo and Shinagawa stations) and [Osaka](e2157.html) (Shin-Osaka Station) are connected with each other by the [JR Tokaido Shinkansen](e2018_tokaido.html). Nozomi trains require about 155 minutes to reach Shin-Osaka Station from Tokyo, Hikari trains about 3 hours and Kodama trains about 4 hours.

The regular one way fare is 13,870 yen by non-reserved seat or around 14,500 yen by reserved seat. The [Japan Rail Pass](e2361.html) is valid on Hikari and Kodama trains, but a supplement fee of 4,960 yen is required on Nozomi trains.

The [Tokyo-Osaka Hokuriku Arch Pass](e2361_arch.html) is a [rail pass](e2357.html) that allows holders to travel between Tokyo and Osaka via [Kanazawa](e2167.html), using the [Hokuriku Shinkansen](e2018_nagano.html). It is not the fastest way to travel between Tokyo and Osaka, but it allows pass holders to visit the less-explored Hokuriku Region along the way. It costs 24,500 yen and is valid for seven consecutive days.

The one way trip from Tokyo to Osaka by [highway bus](e2366.html) takes about 8 hours. There are daytime and overnight buses. Fierce competition on the Tokyo-Osaka route has produced a wide variety of comfort levels (from discount to super premium buses) and an abundance of low priced offers. Typical one way fares for discount buses, such as [Willer Express](https://willerexpress.com/en/bus_search/tokyo/all/osaka/all/?utm_source=web&utm_medium=ad&utm_campaign=af01&aid=184), start from around 2500 yen; while premium buses charge up to 20,000 yen. Online reservations can be made through [Willer](https://willerexpress.com/en/bus_search/tokyo/all/osaka/all/?utm_source=web&utm_medium=ad&utm_campaign=af01&aid=184) and [Japan Bus Online](https://japanbusonline.com/en/AreaSearch2/3130000/5271004/?afcd=MDI=).

Multiple airlines operate between Tokyo and Osaka. A majority of flights use Tokyo's [Haneda Airport](e2430.html) and Osaka's [Itami Airport](e2433.html), but a smaller number of flights also serve Tokyo's [Narita Airport](e2027.html) and Osaka's [Kansai Airport](e2033.html). The regular one way fare by conventional airlines is about 31,000 yen, however, few travelers pay more than 15,000 yen thanks to various [discount fares](e2364.html). One way fares by [discount airlines](e2364.html) start from around 5000 yen, but most are using the less centrally located [Narita Airport](e2027.html) and [Kansai Airport](e2033.html). Flight duration is one hour.

[Driving](e2024.html) between Tokyo and Osaka via the Tomei and Meishin expressways takes about six hours without breaks and traffic jams. The [expressway](e2354.html) toll is around 14,000 yen one way.

Above fees and schedules are subject to change. Be sure to check current yen [exchange rates](e2196.html).

[Osaka](e2157.html) has two major city centers and four major train stations. The two city centers are nicknamed **Kita** ("North") around Osaka/Umeda Station and **Minami** ("South") around Namba Station. While [Kita](e4009.html) is a large shopping and business area, [Minami](e4001.html) is Osaka's most famous entertainment district.

JR **Osaka Station** is located in the center of the [Kita](e4009.html) district. Two other railway companies and three subway lines have their own stations in the vicinity of JR Osaka Station. Note that some of them are named after the Umeda district rather than Osaka. The [shinkansen](e2018.html) trains stop not at Osaka Station, but at **Shin-Osaka Station**, one station north of Osaka Station by JR train.

In the Namba area ([Minami](e4001.html)), four railway companies (JR, Nankai, Kintetsu and Hankyu) and three subway lines have their separate stations, all named **Namba Station**. The fourth of Osaka's major railway stations is **Tennoji Station** in the southeast of central Osaka. It is served by JR, Kintetsu Railway, the Hankai Tramway and two subway lines.

The city of [Osaka](e2157.html) is served by over seven different [railway](e2019.html) and subway companies. Most relevant to foreign visitors of Osaka are the subway lines and the lines operated by JR West. The lines operated by the other private railway companies are useful for accessing neighboring cities and regions.

* **JR West** operates a dense network of local train lines in the [Osaka](e2157.html) area. The most prominent line is the Osaka Loop Line, the equivalent to [Tokyo's Yamanote Line](e2370.html). JR also operates lines to [Kansai Airport](e2033.html), [Kobe](e2159.html), [Kyoto](e2158.html), [Nara](e2165.html) and to the [Universal Studios](e4021.html). The [shinkansen](e2018.html) (bullet trains) stop at Shin-Osaka Station.
* **Subways** are often the most convenient means of getting around central Osaka. The city has eight subway lines that cover especially the area inside the Osaka Loop Line. The subway offers the quickest connection between Osaka's two main districts [Kita](e4009.html) and [Minami](e4001.html) and is of great value to foreign visitors in general.
* **Nankai Railway** connects [Namba](e4001.html) to [Kansai Airport](e2033.html), Wakayama and [Mount Koya](e4900.html) (Koyasan).
* **Hankyu Railway** connects Osaka-Umeda Station with northern Osaka, [Kobe](e2159.html) and [Kyoto](e2158.html).
* **Kintetsu Railway** connects Osaka with many destinations in the southern [Kansai Region](/list/e1105.html), including [Nara](e2165.html), [Kyoto](e2158.html), [Asuka](e4175.html), [Yoshino](e4150.html), [Ise](e4301.html) and [Nagoya](e2155.html). Lines start at [Namba](e4001.html) (Osaka-Namba Station), [Tennoji](e4025.html) (Osaka-Abenobashi Station) and Nagata stations.
* **Hanshin Railway** connects [Osaka](e2157.html) with [Kobe](e2159.html). The lines start at Osaka-Umeda and Osaka-Namba stations.
* **Keihan Railway** connects central [Osaka](e2157.html) with central [Kyoto](e2158.html) and [Uji](e3975.html). The lines start at Yodoyabashi and Nakanoshima stations.

The prepaid [IC card](e2359_003.html) available in [Osaka](e2157.html) is called **Icoca**. It does not give you any discounts over regular tickets, but it makes the process of [taking trains](e2016.html) easier, as you do not always need to buy a ticket before riding a train. Icoca cards can be purchased through ticket machines at JR stations. Local non-JR railway companies offer their own IC card, called Pitapa; however, Pitapa is a postpaid card that works more like a credit card and cannot be used by tourists.

Icoca can be used on most trains and buses in the [Greater Osaka](/list/e1105.html) region (and many [other major cities](e2359_003.html) in Japan). Additionally, [eight other IC cards](e2359_003.html) from other major cities of Japan can also be used on the trains and buses of Greater Osaka, including Suica, Pasmo, Kitaca, Toica, Manaca, Sugoca, Nimoca and Hayakaken.

The **Kansai One Pass** is a special version of Icoca exclusively for foreign tourists that additionally qualifies for discounts at various attractions in the [Kansai Region](/list/e1105.html); however, it will be discontinued from November 2025. It is available for sale at [Kansai Airport](e2033.html) and major railway stations in the Kansai Region.
