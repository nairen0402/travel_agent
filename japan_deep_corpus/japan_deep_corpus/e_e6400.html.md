Narita (成田) is a city in [Chiba Prefecture](/list/e1212.html), roughly 60 kilometers east of central [Tokyo](e2164.html). The city is most famous as the site of Tokyo's international airport, [Narita Airport](e2027.html).

Narita's main tourist attraction is [Naritasan](e6401.html), a popular Buddhist [temple](e2058.html) with a history of over 1000 years. But the city and surroundings have several other attractions that can keep transit travelers and those with excess time at the airport busy for some time.
