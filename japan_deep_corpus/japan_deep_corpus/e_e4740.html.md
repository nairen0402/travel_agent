Usuki (臼杵) is a former [castle town](e2296.html) located on the east coast of [Oita Prefecture](/list/e1243.html) in [Kyushu](/list/e1108.html). It is famous for its numerous [stone Buddhas](e4742.html) which are sculpted into the walls of cliffs and designated as national treasures. In Japan, Buddha statues are usually made of wood or metal, and stone Buddhas are rare.

Usuki's city center is situated about five kilometers from the [stone Buddhas](e4742.html) and maintains a charming old castle town atmosphere. Its former [samurai district](e4743.html) is characterized by stone-paved alleys lined by traditional buildings, some open to tourists.
