The Philosopher's Path (哲学の道, Tetsugaku no michi) is a pleasant stone path through the northern part of [Kyoto](e2158.html)'s Higashiyama district. The path follows a canal which is lined by hundreds of [cherry trees](e2011.html). Usually in early April these trees explode with color, making this one of the city's most popular [hanami](e2011.html) (cherry blossom viewing) [spots](e3951.html).

Approximately two kilometers long, the path begins around [Ginkakuji](e3907.html) (Silver Pavilion) and ends in the neighborhood of [Nanzenji](e3905.html). The path got its name due to Nishida Kitaro, one of Japan's most famous philosophers, who was said to practice meditation while walking this route on his daily commute to Kyoto University.

[Restaurants](e2036.html), cafes, and boutiques can be found along the path, as well as a number of smaller temples and shrines which are a short walk from the canal. The most notable of the temples is Honen-in, with an entrance gate that is quite spectacular especially during the [autumn](e3953.html).

The canal that follows the path is part of the Lake Biwa Canal which connects through tunnels to Lake Biwa in nearby [Shiga Prefecture](/list/e1224.html). The canal was built during the [Meiji Period](e2130.html) (1868 - 1912) to enhance transportation and provide Kyoto with additional water. A beautiful aqueduct, which is part of the canal network, can be seen around [Nanzenji](e3905.html).

Honen-in Temple

The Philosopher's Path runs between [Ginkakuji](e3907.html) and the neighborhood of [Nanzenji](e3905.html), a 5-10 minute walk north of Nanzenji's main temple buildings.
