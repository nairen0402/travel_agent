Entrance to the Bat Cave

[Mount Fuji](e2172.html)'s past eruptions and resulting lava flows have created multiple caves in the [Fuji Five Lake](e6900.html) region around the mountain's northern base.

Today, three of these caves have been developed and opened to tourists to be explored without special equipment or guides. Take caution, however, as some of the caves have passages with low ceilings and steep steps that can be slippery when wet.

The three caves are:

* 

  Bat Cave

  Hours: 9:00 to 17:00  
  Closed: December 1 to March 19  
  Admission: 350 yen

  The Bat Cave, named after its former winter inhabitants, is the most extensive of the three caves. In total the cave is nearly 350 meters long and has multiple large chambers and diverging tunnels to be explored. Some of the tunnels come with rather low ceilings.
* 

  Ice Cave

  Hours: 9:00 to 17:00 (shorter hours in winter)  
  Closed: No closing days  
  Admission: 350 yen

  Even during the summer, the temperature in the Ice Cave usually stays below freezing. Consequently the cave has been used since the early 1900s to store ice for use around the year. The circular walk through this cave is not very long, but contains passages with low ceilings and slippery stairs.
* 

  Wind Cave

  Hours: 9:00 to 17:00 (shorter hours in winter)  
  Closed: No closing days  
  Admission: 350 yen

  In the past, this cave was used as a natural storehouse and refrigerator, as the temperature inside stays at a relatively constant zero degrees Celsius throughout the year. The cave is furnished with a few shelves that store boxes of acorns and silkworm cocoons. It is the most easily walkable and least exciting of the three caves.

The [Omni Bus Green Line](e6905.html) (Saiko Line) connects Kawaguchiko Station with the caves. For the Bat Cave, get off at Saiko-Komoriana (35 minutes) in front of the cave. For the Wind Cave, get off at Fugaku-Fuketsu (50 minutes; also served by the infrequent Blue Line in 30 minutes from Kawaguchiko Station). The Ice Cave is a 15 minute eastwards along the main road from the Wind Cave or a short walk from the Narusawa Hyoketsu bus stop along the Blue Line.

Alternatively, the Ice Cave and Wind Cave can be accessed by regular [buses](e2015.html) from Kawaguchiko Station in the direction of [Lake Motosuko](e6910.html) and Shin-Fuji Station. For the Ice Cave get off at Hyoketsu and for the Wind Cave at Fuketsu bus stops. The one way ride takes about 15 minutes and costs around 750 yen one way. There are departures every 1-2 hours.
