Katsura Imperial Villa (桂離宮, Katsura Rikyū) is one of the finest examples of [Japanese architecture](e2111.html) and [garden](e2099.html) design. The villa and garden in their present form were completed in 1645 as the residence for the Katsura Family, members of Japan's [Imperial Family](e2135.html).

Visiting Katsura Imperial Villa requires joining a tour. The tour follows the garden's circular walking trail around the central pond. Palace buildings can be viewed only from the outside, and photographing is allowed only from designated spots. Tours in English are available.

Katsura Rikyu is located in western [Kyoto](e2158.html), a 15 minute walk from Katsura Station on the Hankyu Kyoto Line. Alternatively, you can reach the villa by Kyoto City Bus number 33 from Kyoto Station in about 20 minutes. Get off at "Katsura Rikyu-mae" bus stop. The bus ride costs 270 yen and is not fully covered by the [Kyoto City Bus One Day Card](e2363.html). There are about two buses per hour. Alternatively, you can also take Keihan Bus numbers 2 and 26.
