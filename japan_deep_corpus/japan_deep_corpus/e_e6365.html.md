Fujinomiya (富士宮) is a city in [Shizuoka Prefecture](/list/e1218.html) on the southwestern slopes of [Mount Fuji](e2172.html). The city grew up around [Fujinomiya Sengen Shrine](e6367.html), the most prominent and important shrine in the region, which is also the traditional starting point of the approach up the mountain. Many visitors still start the [climb](e6901.html) from Fujinomiya via the [Fujinomiya 5th Station](e6930.html), as it is the shortest and one of the most popular routes up the mountain.

Fujinomiya is also home to the [Shiraito Falls](e6368.html), one of Japan's most beautiful waterfalls. The falls can be found in the outskirts of the city along the way to the [Fuji Five Lakes](e6900.html) region on the northern side of the mountain.
