The Shimabara Peninsula (島原半島, Shimabara Hantō) is a popular [hot spring](e2292.html) and [hiking](e2427.html) destination that lies to the east of [Nagasaki City](e2162.html). Formed by the volcanic eruptions of [Mount Unzen](e4452.html) at its center, the peninsula was the site of several deadly volcanic eruptions, including recent [eruptions in the 1990s](e4455.html) in which several people were killed and some outskirts of [Shimabara City](e4454.html) were destroyed.

Mount Unzen is part of the Unzen Amakusa National Park, one of the first [national parks](e2325.html) in Japan. [Unzen Onsen](e4453.html), an attractive [hot spring](e2292.html) resort town, can be found near the peak of the still active volcano. The peninsula is also known for the [Shimabara Rebellion](e4456.html), a significant peasant uprising during the [Edo Period](e2128.html) (1603-1868) that involved many local [Christians](e2298.html).
