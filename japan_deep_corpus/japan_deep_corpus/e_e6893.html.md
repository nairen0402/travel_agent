Asahikawa Ramen

Like several other places in [Hokkaido](/list/e1101.html), [Asahikawa](e6890.html) is famous for its [ramen](e2042.html). Whereas [Sapporo](e2163.html) is known for its [miso](e2045.html) based broth and [Hakodate](e5350.html) for its salt based broth, Asahikawa is known for its [shoyu](e2045.html) (soya sauce) based broths. Shops serving shoyu based ramen can be found throughout the city.

The broth of Asahikawa Ramen (旭川ラーメン) is also known for being quite oily, and there is often a thin layer of oil on top of the soup. Another characteristic of the local ramen is the generally thin, hard and wavy noodles. The range of toppings is quite typical and includes green onions, pork, bamboo shoots and eggs.

On the outskirts of the city there is an interesting collection of ramen shops called the **Asahikawa Ramen Village**. Eight famous ramen restaurants from Asahikawa have opened small branch stores besides one another in the complex alongside a gift shop and a small ramen [shrine](e2059.html).

Asahikawa Ramen Village

Ramen shops can be found throughout downtown Asahikawa.

The **Ramen Village** is about five kilometers northeast of JR Asahikawa Station and not conveniently accessed by [public transportation](e627.html). It can be reached by infrequent [trains](e2019.html) (10 minutes, 320 yen from Asahikawa Station, get off at Minami-Nagayama Station from where the village is a five minute walk) or by [bus](e2015.html) (35 minutes from Asahikawa Station, get off at Nagayama-Jujo-yonchome bus stop from where the village is a five minute walk). It is more easily accessed by [car](e2024.html).
