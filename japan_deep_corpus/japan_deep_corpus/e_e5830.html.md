Izumo (出雲) is a city along the rural Sanin Coast of the Sea of Japan. The area owes its fame to its crowning attraction and namesake, [Izumo Taisha](e5804.html) (Izumo Grand Shrine), one of Japan's oldest and most sacred [Shinto shrines](e2059.html). With millennia-old legends surrounding its iconic shrine, and being within quick reach of history-rich [Matsue](e5800.html), Izumo is a fantastic place to explore some of Japan's ancient [history](e641.html) and mythology.
