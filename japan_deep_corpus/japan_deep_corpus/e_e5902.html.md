Because of its valuable timber resources, the Hida Region around [Takayama](e5900.html) was put under direct control of the [Tokugawa Shogunate](e2128.html) in 1692. The Takayama Jinya (高山陣屋) served as the local government office headed by the officials dispatched from [Edo](e2164.html) (present day Tokyo).

The building complex was in official use until 1969 and is now open to the public as a museum. It includes various nicely maintained [tatami rooms](e2007.html) that once served as offices, conference rooms, guest rooms and residential space. There is also an interesting interrogation room.

Beside the main building stands a large storehouse built in the 1600s. Known as the biggest traditional rice storehouse in Japan, it now functions as a museum, showcasing belongings and official documents of past local leaders, old maps of the Hida Region and historic town plans.

Conference room

Takayama Jinya is located in the [old town](e5903.html) near the Nakabashi Bridge, easily reached on foot in about ten minutes from Takayama Station.
