Morioka (盛岡) is the capital city of [Iwate Prefecture](/list/e1204.html), approximately 2.5 hours by the [Tohoku Shinkansen](e2018_tohoku.html) north of [Tokyo](e2164.html). Surrounded by mountains on three sides and blessed with multiple rivers, Morioka is an attractive city and a convenient transportation hub.

During the [feudal ages](e2128.html), the region around Morioka, including the eastern part of today's [Aomori Prefecture](/list/e1202.html), was governed by the Nambu clan from [Morioka Castle](e5054.html). Their family name became synonymous with the domain, and some traditional goods from the region still contain the name Nambu. The most famous example is [Nambu Tekki](e5055.html), handmade ironware.

The city is also well known for [its various styles of noodles](e5053.html). While central Morioka may lack major sightseeing spots, there are a handful of minor sites of interest across the city. Furthermore, the [Koiwai Farm](e5052.html), one of Japan's oldest and most famous [dairy farms](e2463.html), is located 15 kilometers west of the city.
