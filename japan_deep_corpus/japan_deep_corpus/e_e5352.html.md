Fort Goryokaku from Goryokaku Tower

Fort Goryokaku (五稜郭, Goryōkaku) is a massive, star-shaped, Western-style citadel, which was built in the last years of the [Edo Period](e2128.html) (1603-1868) for the defense of [Hakodate](e5350.html) against the imperialist threat posed by the Western powers. A few years later, the fort became the site of a civil war between an army of the shogunate and the superior troops of the newly established [Meiji government](e2130.html).

After the fort had lost its military importance, it was eventually turned into a public park in the 1910s. Over one thousand [cherry trees](e2011.html) were planted along its moats, making it one of [Hokkaido](/list/e1101.html)'s best [cherry blossom spots](e2011_where.html). The peak of the blooming season usually takes place around early May.

Former Magistrate Office

In the center of the fort stands the **Former Magistrate Office**, from where the officers of the [shogunate](e2128.html) used to administer the island of [Hokkaido](/list/e1101.html). The original building was demolished after the fall of the shogunate in 1871, but the city meticulously reconstructed a part of the complex and opened it to the public in 2010.

For a bird's eye view of the huge fortress, access the observation deck of the nearby **Goryokaku Tower**. The 107 meter tall tower replaced its 60 meter tall predecessor in 2006.

From Hakodate Station, take the tram to "Goryokaku Koen-mae" (五稜郭公園前, 15 minutes, 230 yen one way), from where the fortress is another ten minutes on foot.
