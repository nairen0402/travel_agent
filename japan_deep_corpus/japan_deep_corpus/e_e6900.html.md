The Fuji Five Lake (富士五湖, Fujigoko) region lies at the northern base of [Mount Fuji](e2172.html) about 1000 meters above sea level around the lakes [Kawaguchiko](e6906.html), [Saiko](e6907.html), [Yamanakako](e6908.html), [Shojiko](e6909.html) and [Motosuko](e6910.html). It is one of the best places to view Mount Fuji from a close distance and a good base for [climbing the mountain](e6901.html).

Fujigoko is known as a lake resort area, where [hiking](e2427.html), camping, fishing and [snow sports](e2262.html) are among the popular outdoor activities that can be enjoyed. There are also plenty of [hot springs](e6902.html) and [museums](e6927.html) found in the area, along with [Fuji Q Highland](e6918.html), one of Japan's most popular [amusement parks](e2067.html) with record-breaking roller coasters.

Among the lakes, [Lake Kawaguchiko](e6906.html) is the easiest to access and offers the most things to see and do for the average foreign traveler. The four other lakes are less developed than Lake Kawaguchiko and are not as easy to access by public transportation.
