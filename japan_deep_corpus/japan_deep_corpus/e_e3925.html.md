Maruyama Park (円山公園, Maruyama Kōen) is a public park next to [Yasaka Shrine](e3903.html) in the [Higashiyama District](e3959.html). In the first half of April, when the [cherry trees](e2011.html) are in full bloom, the park becomes [Kyoto](e2158.html)'s most popular and most crowded [spot](e3951.html) for cherry blossom viewing parties ([hanami](e2011_how.html)). The centerpiece of the park is a tall [shidarezakura](e2011_species.html) (weeping cherry tree), which gets lit up in the night.

Maruyama Park can be reached by bus from [Kyoto Station](e3922.html) in about 20 minutes. Take number 206 and get off at Gion bus stop. The park is just behind [Yasaka Shrine](e3903.html).

Alternatively, the park can be reached in a 20+ minute walk from Kiyomizudera through the narrow lanes of the [Higashiyama District](e3959.html).
