View of Ogimachi from the Shiroyama Viewpoint

The main reason for the steep roofs and massive structure of [Shirakawago](e5950.html)'s farmhouses is the large amount of snow the region receives every winter. [Ogimachi Village](e5951.html) typically gets covered by one to two meters of snow during the peak of the white season.

While causing the locals quite a bit of hardship, the snow turns Shirakawago into an idyllic winter landscape. To make it even better, the village organizes special illumination events on selected Sunday evenings in January and February which attract plenty of tourists. During the light-up event, many of the village's gassho-zukuri farmhouses are lit up from 17:30 to 19:30.

In 2026, Ogimachi is scheduled to be illuminated on the following dates:

* January 12, 2026 (Monday, [national holiday](e2062.html))
* January 18, 2026 (Sunday)
* January 25, 2026 (Sunday)
* February 1, 2026 (Sunday)

Because the number of visitors to the light-up event has grown too large in recent years, the number of visitors allowed into the village is now limited in order to avoid overcrowding and traffic jams and to ensure a safe and pleasant experience for all visitors. **It is mandatory for everybody to get an advance reservation** and ticket in order to visit the village during the light-up events. Below are the three possible ways to visit:

1. **Visit by bus tour**
     
   Several local bus companies, [Nohi Bus](https://www.nouhibus.co.jp/shirakawa_lightup_2026-en/), [Kaetsuno Bus](https://www.kaetsunou.co.jp/16779/), [Hokutetsu Bus](https://www.hokutetsu.co.jp/news/shirakawago-lightup/), [Toyama Chiho Tetsudo](https://www.chitetsu.co.jp/?p=79019) and [Iruka Kotsu](https://www.iruka-net.jp/archives/4824), offer bus tours for seeing the light-up event, some of which include an admission ticket for the [Shiroyama Viewpoint](#shiroyama). Furthermore, several other [tour companies](e2275.html), including [Willer](https://willer-travel.com/en/hotel-bus-tour/shirakawago-lightup/?aid=184), also offer travel packages to see the event, but they do not include admission tickets for the viewpoint. Advance reservations should be made directly through the bus companies or travel agencies. The time period when reservations are accepted depends on the company and tour, but typically starts around early October.
2. **Visit by car**
     
   Visiting the event by [car](e2024.html) requires an advance online reservation for a parking lot. Reservations can be made on a first-come first-serve basis during two separate sessions starting September 10 at 1pm (6000-9000 yen per car) and December 1 at 1pm (7000-10000 yen per car) on the [tourist association's website](https://shirakawa-go.gr.jp/en/). Visitors accessing Shirakawago by car are not able to purchase tickets for the [Shiroyama Viewpoint](#shiroyama). Winter tires and winter driving skills are required to access Shirakawago in winter by car.
3. **Stay overnight**
     
   The best way to enjoy the light-up event is by [staying overnight at one of the farmhouses](e5952.html) in the village. Because of the limited number of rooms, a lottery-based reservation system is in place for many of the local lodgings. Submissions can be made during the month of October, and results are announced on November 10. Overnight visitors get the privilege of a parking lot and a ticket to the [Shiroyama Viewpoint](#shiroyama).

Note that visiting the light-up event by [regular bus](/bus/shirakawago.html) is not possible, because the last buses of the day depart Shirakawago before the start of the light-up event. Also, note that visiting by [taxi](e2021.html) requires the reservation of a parking lot (see under "Visit by car" above).

Just like during daytime, the [Shiroyama Viewpoint](e5951.html#viewpoint) is one of the best places to enjoy the sight of the village. **However**, due to limited space, the only way to access the viewpoint during the light-up event is with an admission ticket for a given time slot, which cannot be selected. These tickets are available only to people who stay overnight at a lodging in the village or participate in selected [bus tours](#bus). The observation deck has to be accessed on foot from the village. A bus is available for visitors with mobility issues, but needs to be reserved in advance.

Visitors to [Shirakawago](e5950.html) note that temperature can drop far below freezing during the light-up event, and that roads and trails are covered by snow and sometimes ice. Appropriate clothing, face protection and shoes are required. Some parts of the village are, furthermore, not well lit with dangerous, uncovered water canals flanking the trails. To reduce the burden on the small village, all tourists are also asked to carry home any [garbage](e2222.html) they produce.
