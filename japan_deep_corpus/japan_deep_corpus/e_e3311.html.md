Midland Square is [Nagoya](e2155.html)'s tallest building, located just opposite [Nagoya Station](e3305.html). The skyscraper is 247 meters tall and opened in 2007, adding to the increasing number of skyscrapers around [Nagoya](e2155.html)'s city center. The first four stories and the basement of the building house many shops, chic boutiques, restaurants and cafes. A cinema is on the 5th floor.

Of interest to tourists is the **Sky Promenade**, located on the top three floors of the 46 story building. This is an open-air observation deck with panoramic views over [Nagoya](e2155.html). Key landmarks that can be seen from the Sky Promenade include the [JR Central Towers](e3305.html), [Nagoya Castle](e3300.html) and [Nagoya Port](e3307.html). Several exquisite restaurants are located on the 41st and 42nd stories, serving different types of Japanese and international cuisine and offering tables with impressive aerial views of the city.

Sky Promenade - railings prevent visitors from approaching the windows, making it difficult to take good photos
