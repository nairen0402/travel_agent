Important Notice:

The popular website Hyperdia discontinued offering timetable data from April 2022.

Japan has an extensive and efficient [train network](e2019.html); however, without an intimate knowledge of the system, its complexity can make it difficult to figure out an efficient route. On top of that, while most railway, bus and ferry companies publish their timetables online, few offer good English language resources. Luckily there are several good English online route finders available on the internet to help travelers navigate the railway system in Japan.

Route finders allow you to find transportation routes between any two train stations in Japan. Below are some of the better tools available:

### Jorudan (aka Japan Transit Planner)

[Jorudan](https://world.jorudan.co.jp/mln/en/) has been around since the early days of the Internet. Today, Jorudan offers a [website](https://world.jorudan.co.jp/mln/en/) and an [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.jorudan.japantransit&hl=en), both of which come with free search functions and some additional paid functions. The free options available differ between the web and app, with the app version being greatly superior to the website.

The free app allows to exclude specific train categories (e.g. [shinkansen](/e/e2018.html) or [limited express](/e/e2016_limited_express.html) trains), includes a [Japan Rail Pass](/e/e2361.html) option, which allows results to be limited to trains covered by the pass, and also lists platform details and stations along the way. None of these features are provided by the free web version.

**Covers:** train, plane and bus

**Pros and cons:**

* has Japan Rail Pass option (app only)
* shows stations along the way (app only)
* shows platform numbers (app only)
* allows to exclude certain train categories (except free website)
* the free website version is limited to the very basics

Website: <https://world.jorudan.co.jp/mln/en/>
  
Android app: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.jorudan.japantransit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.jorudan.japantransit&hl=en)
  
iPhone app: <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/japan-transit-planner/id299490481>

### Navitime (aka Japan Travel by Navitime)

The English route search service by [Navitime](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/route/) is very powerful and comes as a [website](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/route/) and [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.navitime.inbound.walk&hl=en). Not only does Navitime offer a [Japan Rail Pass](/e/e2361.html) option, but it can similarly handle several other [rail passes](/e/e2357.html). It also allows to exclude results by [train category](/e/e2016.html) and other means of transport. Besides covering [train](/e/e2019.html) and [flight](/e/e2365.html) connections, Navitime is particularly strong with [bus](/e/e2015.html) connections across Japan and also covers [driving](/e/e2024.html) routes, [taxi fares](/e/e2021.html) and [expressway tolls](/e/e2354.html).

However, some of the advanced options, such as additional timetable details and the ability to select more than one rail pass, are available only with a paid plan. In recent years Navitime has also become increasingly active in offering links to booking services, some of which charge rather large service fees.

**Covers:** train, plane, bus, taxi, car, walk

**Pros and cons:**

* has Japan Rail Pass (and other rail passes) option
* can exclude certain train categories or transport types
* shows platform numbers
* shows taxi fares and expressway tolls
* has wheelchair-friendly and eco-friendly options
* some of the advanced features are not available with the free version
* the linked booking service for JR tickets charges a service fee of around 20%

Website: <https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/route/>
  
Android app: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.navitime.inbound.walk](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.navitime.inbound.walk&hl=en)
  
iPhone app: <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/japan-travel-route-map-jr/id686373726>

### Google Maps

Last but not least there is [Google](https://www.google.com/maps). Google map search results are tremendously powerful and not limited to [trains](/e/e2019.html), [buses](/e/e2015.html) and [flights](/e/e2365.html), but also cover [car](/e/e2024.html), [bicycle](/e/e2210.html), walk and [wheelchair](/e/e2301.html)-friendly options, while being interlinked with other useful Google services.

However, the Google Map connection tool does not currently allow users to exclude certain [train categories](/e/e2016.html) from their search results and does not feature a [Japan Rail Pass](/e/e2361.html) option to exclude trains that are not covered by the popular rail pass.

**Covers:** train, plane, bus, car, bicycle, walk

**Pros and cons:**

* shows stations along the way
* shows platform numbers
* has wheelchair-friendly option
* has no Japan Rail Pass option
* does not allow to exclude certain train categories

### Printed timetables

Printed railway timetables in Japanese are sold in bookstores and kiosks across Japan. Both nationwide timetables as well as those covering a specific region or railway company are available. The largest timetable books contain [kana](e2047.html) readings for all station names, but they can still be rather difficult to use without [Japanese](e621.html) reading skills. Unfortunately, comprehensive printed English timetables are not widely available, however some rail companies print booklets and pamphlets of timetables for selected routes.

Among the most complete nationwide timetables are the JR and JTB timetable books, which are published monthy in full and pocket versions. Besides the full schedules of all [train](e2019.html) lines operated by Japan Railways (JR), they contain the basic schedules of trains by other [railway](e2019.html), [bus](e2366.html), [ferry](e2355.html) and [airline](e2365.html) companies as well as a wide array of practical information covering topics such as discount tickets, fares and regulations.
