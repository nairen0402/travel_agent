The map below shows the trains, cablecars, ropeways, boats and bus lines covered by the Hakone Kamakura Pass:

### Validity

1. Unlimited use of Odakyu trains on the entire Odakyu network, including the Odakyu Odawara Line, Odakyu Enoshima Line and Odakyu Tama Line. However, if you use a "Romance Car" [limited express](e2016.html#category) train, a seat reservation is required at an additional charge. Seat reservations can be made on the [e-Romancecar website](https://www.web-odakyu.com/e-romancecar/?language=en) or at ticket machines and ticket offices of Odakyu stations.
2. Unlimited use of Enoden trains between Fujisawa and [Kamakura](e2166.html).
3. Unlimited use of Odakyu-affiliated transportation in Hakone:
   * [Hakone Tozan Railway](e5202.html)
   * Hakone Tozan Cablecar
   * [Hakone Ropeway](e5223.html)
   * [Hakone Sightseeing Boats](e5201.html)

   * Tokai Bus (Hakone-Mishima)- Discounted admission to selected attractions in the area covered by the pass.
   - The pass is valid on three consecutive calendar days (midnight to midnight).

### Points of sale

The pass can be purchased as a [digital pass](https://pc.emot-tickets.jp/?language=en&masterBookId=443&set=true&site=odakyuglobal) for use on a [smartphone](e2223.html), as a paper ticket at the Odakyu Sightseeing Service Center in [Shinjuku](e3011.html) Station or through third-party vendors, such as [Japan Experience](https://affiliate.japan-experience.com/click?o=4&a=31&link_id=861), in which case a voucher has to be exchanged to the actual pass in Japan.

### Assessment

The Hakone Kamakura Pass is 220 yen cheaper than a 2-day [Hakone Free Pass](e2358_008.html) (7,100 yen) and [Enoshima-Kamakura Free Pass](e2358_003.html) (1,640 yen) combined. It will generally also come cheaper than regular tickets, because transportation around Hakone, in particular, tends to be expensive.

A further advantage of the Hakone Kamakura Pass over the two before-mentioned passes is that it allows for unlimited use of the entire Odakyu railway network, while the other two passes restrict use of Odakyu trains to a round trip between [Shinjuku](e3011.html) and their respective coverage areas. This allows pass holders to explore other attractions along the Odakyu lines or to maintain a base in [Tokyo](e2164.html) and explore [Hakone](e5200.html) in multiple side trips from Tokyo.
