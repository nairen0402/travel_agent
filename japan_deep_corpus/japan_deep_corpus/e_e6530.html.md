The Saitama Prefectural Museum of History and Folklore (歴史と民俗の博物館, Rekishi to Minzoku no Hakubutsukan) is located in Omiya Park, within walking distance of the [Omiya Bonsai Village](e6528.html) and [Hikawa Shrine](e6529.html). It recounts the history of Japan, with a big emphasis on [Saitama Prefecture](/list/e1213.html) and the former Musashi Province, which covered much of today's Greater Tokyo, including [Saitama City](e6525.html).

The museum showcases a wide permanent collection of excavated artifacts and belongings left behind from the [Jomon Period](e2131.html) (13000 BC to 300 BC) to the [Edo Period](e2128.html) (1603-1868). The facility also houses some national treasures and exhibits models and paintings depicting life and important events in the past. Visitors can learn about the geography of the Musashi Province and how the area has changed over the centuries. Besides the permanent exhibition, temporary exhibitions with various themes are also held periodically.

The Saitama Prefectural Museum of History and Folklore is a ten minute walk from Omiya Koen Station (5 minutes, 160 yen one way from Omiya Station by Tobu Noda Line). The [Omiya Bonsai Village](e6528.html) can be reached in a 15 minute walk northeast, while [Hikawa Shrine](e6529.html) is at a similar distance to the south.
