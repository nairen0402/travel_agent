[Mount Norikuradake](e6041.html) (乗鞍岳) is one of Japan's top 100 mountains and the southernmost peak of the [Northern Japan Alps](e6043.html). Located near [Kamikochi](e6040.html) along the border between [Gifu](/list/e1220.html) and [Nagano](/list/e1216.html) prefectures, the mountain and the [Norikura Kogen](e6044.html) highlands at its base provide ample scenic spots with mountain vistas, lush forests, cascading waterfalls and attractive [hiking](e2427.html) trails.

Due to its high elevation, Mount Norikuradake is one of the first places in Japan to see [autumn colors](e2014.html). The alpine plants usually begin to change around mid to late September in the higher elevations, and the season lasts into October as the colors make their way down the mountain slopes. Several [hot springs](e2292.html) are also found in the area, especially at nearby [Shirahone Onsen](e6042.html).
