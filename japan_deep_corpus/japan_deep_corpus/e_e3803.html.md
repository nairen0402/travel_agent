Sanbutsudo Hall

Rinnoji (輪王寺, Rinnōji) is [Nikko](e3800.html)'s most important [temple](e2058.html). It was founded by Shodo Shonin, the Buddhist monk who introduced [Buddhism](e2055.html) to Nikko in the 8th century.

The temple's main building, the **Sanbutsudo**, houses large, gold lacquered, wooden statues of Amida, Senju-Kannon ("Kannon with a thousand arms") and Bato-Kannon ("Kannon with a horse head"). The three deities are regarded as Buddhist manifestations of Nikko's three [mountain deities](e2056.html) which are enshrined at [Futarasan Shrine](e3804.html). A decade-long renovation of the Sanbutsudo was completed in spring 2019.

Opposite Sanbutsudo stands the [temple](e2058.html)'s **treasure house** with [Buddhist](e2055.html) and [Tokugawa](e2128.html) related exhibits. **Shoyoen**, a small [Japanese style garden](e2099.html), is located behind the treasure house. The garden is a popular [autumn leaf spot](e2014_where.html) with its many maple trees standing photogenically around its central pond. [Autumn colors](e2014.html) peak here typically around the first half of November.

Shoyoen Garden

Rinnoji stands just a few steps east of [Toshogu](e3801.html), a 30-40 minute walk or 10 minute bus ride (350 yen one way, 600 yen day pass, covered by the [Nikko Passes](e2358_002.html)) from Tobu and JR Nikko stations.
