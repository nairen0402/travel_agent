Ozu City (大洲, Ōzu) is located in [Ehime Prefecture](/list/e1235.html) on the western coast of [Shikoku](/list/e1107.html). The city emerged during the [Edo Period](e2128.html) (1603-1867) as a [castle town](e2422.html). A section of the [old town](e5529.html) remains today with nostalgic alleys and old-fashioned houses, serving as remembrance both to the days of the Edo Period and the [Meiji Period](e2130.html) (1868-1912). The recently reconstructed [Ozu Castle](e5527.html) stands proudly in the city center as the local icon.

The picturesque Hijikawa River flows through the heart of Ozu City. This is reputedly one of the three greatest destinations in Japan to see [cormorant fishing](e2426.html) (ukai) in the summer, along with [Nagaragawa River](e5922.html) in [Gifu Prefecture](/list/e1220.html) and Mikumagawa River in [Oita Prefecture](/list/e1243.html). [Garyu Sanso](e5528.html), a villa that superbly combines aestheticism and serenity, stands just east of the old town, on the banks of Hijikawa River.
