Yumomi (湯もみ) is the centuries-old method employed to cool down [Kusatsu](e7400.html)'s [hot spring water](e2292_water.html) to bathing temperature without diluting it with cold water and thus attenuating its special qualities.

The cooling is achieved by stirring the water using large wooden paddles and is carried out by a troupe of locals who incorporate a traditional folk song and dance into the process. Yumomi performances are held daily in the Netsunoyu building next to the [Yubatake](e7401.html). They last around half an hour and afford some audience members the opportunity to partake in the stirring.
