The Clock Tower (時計台, Tokeidai) is a symbol of [Sapporo](e2163.html). The building was constructed during the early period of Sapporo's development in [1878](e2130.html) as a drill hall of the Sapporo Agricultural College. In 1881 a clock purchased from Boston was installed.

Today, the Clock Tower serves as a museum with displays about the building's history and Sapporo on the first floor. On the second floor are displays about the clock and a spacious ceremony hall that calls to mind the simple buildings of the colonial American Midwest.
