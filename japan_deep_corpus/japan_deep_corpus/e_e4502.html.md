Suizenji Garden (水前寺成趣園, Suizenji Jōjuen) is a spacious, Japanese style landscape [garden](e2099.html) in [Kumamoto](e4500.html), best enjoyed by strolling along a circular path. It was built by the ruling local lords, the Hosokawa family, in the 17th century.

The [garden](e2099.html) reproduces the 53 post stations of the Tokaido, the important road, which connected [Edo](e2164.html) (today's Tokyo) with [Kyoto](e2158.html) during the [Edo Period](e2128.html) (1603 - 1868), in miniature form, including a small representation of [Mount Fuji](e2172.html).

Suizenji is a 30 minute tram ride (180 yen one way) from JR Kumamoto Station. Get off at the "Suizenji Koen" tram stop, from where the park can be reached in a short walk.

Alternatively, take a train on the JR Hohi Line to Shin-Suizenji Station, the third station from Kumamoto Station (240 yen one way from Kumamoto), from where the park can then be reached in a 5-10 minute walk.
