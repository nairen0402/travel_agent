Cape Oma (大間崎, Ōmasaki) is the northernmost point of the [Shimokita Peninsula](e3725.html) and of the entire Honshu Island, Japan's main island.

The cape looks across over the Tsugaru Kaikyo Strait to [Hokkaido](/list/e1101.html), where the city of [Hakodate](e5350.html) is visible on clear days. Cape Oma's lookout site is lined by restaurants and souvenir shops selling seafood products. An observatory building at the cape looks out across the strait.

Besides its geographical notoriety, Oma is well known for its tuna fishing industry. Oma Tuna are among the best and most expensive in Japan, and most make their way to [Tokyo](e2164.html)'s [Toyosu Market](e3013_market.html) and into sushi restaurants across Japan.
