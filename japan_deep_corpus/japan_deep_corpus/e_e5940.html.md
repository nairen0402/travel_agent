Okuhida (奥飛騨) is a remote region of [Gifu Prefecture](/list/e1220.html) in the mountains of the [Northern Japan Alps](e6043.html). Technically part of [Takayama City](e5900.html), Okuhida is a one hour bus ride outside of central Takayama, just across the border from [Kamikochi](e6040.html) and [Nagano Prefecture](/list/e1216.html).
