Aizu-Wakamatsu (会津若松) is a [castle](e7703.html) town in the interior of [Fukushima Prefecture](/list/e1208.html) which is known for its award-winning [sake](e2037_sake.html) and its [samurai](e2127.html) tradition. Towards the end of Japan's [feudal era](e2128.html), the Aizu clan remained loyal to the shogun, even after the feudal leader had stepped down after the [Meiji Restoration](e2130.html), and opposed the new government during the Boshin War in 1868, which was partially fought in Aizu.

Aizu-Wakamatsu is surrounded by mountains of which [Mount Bandai](e7755.html) is the regional landmark. Many [hiking](e2427.html) and [skiing](e2262.html) opportunities and scenic beauty can be enjoyed in its surroundings.
