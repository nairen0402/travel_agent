Yoyogi Park (代々木公園, Yoyogi Kōen) is one of [Tokyo](e2164.html)'s largest [parks](e3034.html), featuring wide lawns, ponds and forested areas. It is a great place for jogging, picnicking and other outdoor activities.

Although Yoyogi Park has relatively few [cherry trees](e2011.html) compared to other sites in Tokyo, it makes for a nice [hanami spot](e3050.html) in spring (late March to early April). Furthermore, it is known for its [ginkgo tree](e2014_trees.html) forest, which turns intensely golden in [autumn](e2014.html) (late November to early December).

Before becoming a city park in 1967, the area where Yoyogi Park is located served as the site of the Olympic Village for the [1964 Tokyo Olympics](e2260.html), and before that, as a residential area for US military personnel.

Yoyogi Park is a 5 minute walk from Harajuku Station on the [JR Yamanote Line](e2370.html). It is located next to [Meiji Shrine](e3002.html).
