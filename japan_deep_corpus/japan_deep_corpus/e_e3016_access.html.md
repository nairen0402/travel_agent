From/To:

Tokyo StnShinjuku StnIkebukuro StnNarita AirportHaneda Airport

Covered by: [Japan Rail Pass](/e/e2361.html)

Tokyo Station and Maihama Station are connected by frequent local and rapid trains along the JR Keiyo and JR Musashino Lines. The one way trip takes about 15 minutes, costs 230 yen and is fully covered by the [Japan Rail Pass](e2361.html). Note that the JR Keiyo and JR Musashino Lines are about a ten minute walk from the other platforms at Tokyo Station.

Above fees and schedules are subject to change. Be sure to check current yen [exchange rates](e2196.html).

[Tokyo Disney Resort](e3016.html) is located next to JR Maihama Station in Urayasu City, [Chiba Prefecture](/list/e1212.html), just outside the metropolitan borders of [Tokyo](e2164.html). The resort's theme parks, [hotels](e3016_hotels.html) and other attractions are connected with each other and Maihama Station by the **Disney Resort Line**, a monorail service (300 yen per ride), which circles the resort every few minutes in a counter-clockwise direction. Staying guests of the resort's three [Disney Hotels](e3016_hotels.html#disney) receive complimentary monorail passes during their stay.

Alternatively, it is possible to **walk** from Maihama Station to [Tokyo Disneyland](e3016_land.html), the [Ikspiari Shopping Mall](e3016_ikspiari.html), the [Ambassador Hotel](e3016_hotels.html#ambassador) and the [Disneyland Hotel](e3016_hotels.html#disneyland), but [Tokyo DisneySea](e3016_sea.html), the [Hotel MiraCosta](e3016_hotels.html#miracosta) and the [Official Hotels](e3016_hotels.html) are more conveniently accessed by monorail.

Free **shuttle buses** for guests staying at the [Ambassador Hotel](e3016_hotels.html#ambassador) operate between the hotel and the two parks. Furthermore, there are free shuttle buses for guests of the resort's [Official Hotels](e3016_hotels.html#official), which connect the hotels with JR Maihama Station and the monorail's Bayside Station.

Note that a considerable number of long-distance [overnight buses](e2366.html) between Tokyo and several cities across Japan, including [Nagoya](e2155.html), [Kyoto](e2158.html) and [Osaka](e2157.html), also stop at [Tokyo Disney Resort](e3016.html).
