The Higashiyama Walking Course (東山遊歩道, Higashiyama Yūhodō) is a pleasant walking route through [Takayama](e5900.html)'s temple town (Teramachi), the city's rural "suburbs" and Shiroyama Park, a wooded hill and former site of Takayama Castle.

Along the 3.5 kilometer long course, you will pass more than a dozen common [temples](e2058.html) and [shrines](e2059.html), the ruins of Takayama's former [castle](e2296.html) and ordinary scenes of a rural Japanese town. While the Higashiyama Walking Course is by no means a stunning sightseeing experience, it offers a pleasant way to spend one or two hours and get to know [Takayama](e5900.html)'s calmer side.

The starting and ending points of the Higashiyama Walking Course are near the Museum of History and Art, which is about 15 minutes on foot from Takayama Station.
