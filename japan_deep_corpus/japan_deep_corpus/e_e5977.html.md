A small canal, named Seto River (瀬戸川, Setogawa) and inhabited by many carps, runs for about 400 meters through the nicely preserved old town of [Furukawa](e5975.html).

Along its most picturesque section, the canal is lined by old store houses with white walls (shirakabe dozo). The [Furukawa Festival Hall](e5978.html) and [Takumikan Craft Museum](e5979.html) are located at one end of the canal, in the Festival Square.

The canal area can be reached in about five minutes on foot from the station.
