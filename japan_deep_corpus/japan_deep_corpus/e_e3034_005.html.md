Construction Notice:

Updated: December 1, 2025

A large part of the walking trails in the Todoroki Valley is currently closed because a fallen tree prompted the authorities to examine the other trees in the park for safety reasons. The closure started in September 2023, and the park is not expected to be fully reopened until March 2026.

The Todoroki Valley Park (等々力渓谷公園, Todoroki Keikoku Kōen) is one of [Tokyo](e2164.html)'s most unconventional [green spaces](e3034.html). Located in the middle of the densely populated Setagaya city ward, it is an attractive walking trail, leading for about one kilometer through a narrow, wooded valley along a small river and takes about 20 to 30 minutes to walk through.

Several spots of interest can be seen along the walking trail, including a couple of bridges, remains of tunnel tombs and geological rock strata viewing points. At the other end of the valley stands Todoroki Fudo, an atmospheric [temple](e2058.html).

Todoroki Fudo Temple

Todoroki Valley can be reached in a few steps from Todoroki Station on the Tokyu Oimachi Line (20 minutes, 230 yen from [Shibuya](e3007.html)).
