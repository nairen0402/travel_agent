The Kunisaki Peninsula (国東半島, Kunisaki Hantō) is situated in northern [Oita Prefecture](/list/e1243.html), facing the [Seto Inland Sea](e5445.html). It has a number of valleys radiating from Mount Futago at its center. Mostly covered by forests and sparsely populated farmlands, the peninsula is dotted with [temples](e2058.html) of various stature, from the important [Futagoji Temple](e4724.html) and celebrated [Fukiji Temple](e4724.html) to less prominent, small and rustic ones.

The peninsula is home to a unique local Buddhist culture, called "Rokugo Manzan", which contains elements of [Buddhism](e2055.html), [Shinto](e2056.html) and mountain worship, and revolves around the peninsula's numerous [temples](e2058.html) and [Usa Shrine](e4722.html), the head shrine among thousands of Hachiman Shrines in Japan. The predominance of stone statues is a defining characteristic of the Rokugo Manzan culture.

At the south of the peninsula is the city of [Kitsuki](e4725.html) with its lovely, well-preserved [samurai](e2127.html) districts. Oita Airport is also located on the peninsula.
