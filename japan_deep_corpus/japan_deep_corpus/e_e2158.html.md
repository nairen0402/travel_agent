Kyoto (京都, Kyōto) served as Japan's capital and the [emperor](e2135.html)'s residence from [794](e2132.html) until [1868](e2130.html). It is one of the country's ten [largest cities](/list/e1003.html) with 1.5 million inhabitants and a modern face.

Over the centuries, Kyoto was destroyed by many wars and fires, but due to its exceptional historic value, the city was dropped from the list of target cities for the atomic bomb and escaped destruction during [World War II](e2129.html). Countless [temples](e2058.html), [shrines](e2059.html) and other historically priceless structures survive in the city today.
