Dazaifu (太宰府) was established in the late 7th century and served as the administrative center of the entire island of [Kyushu](/list/e1108.html) for over 500 years. The city was built slightly inland from [Fukuoka](e2161.html), whose port was one of the main points of interaction between Japan and mainland Asia. Although the imperial court ruled the country from the [Kansai Region](/list/e1105.html), Dazaifu was pivotal for Japan's diplomatic relations and organizing the country's defenses.

Nowadays, Dazaifu is a small, quiet city on the outskirts of Fukuoka, from which it is perfect for a day trip. There are a number of [temples](e2058.html) and [shrines](e2059.html), the most famous of which is the [Dazaifu Tenmangu Shrine](e4851.html), as well as sites related to Dazaifu's role as the region's administrative center, such as the [Government Office Ruins](e4856.html). In 2005 the massive [Kyushu National Museum](e4855.html) was furthermore opened to the public.
