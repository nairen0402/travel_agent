Aso Shrine's Romon Gate before it collapsed in the 2016 earthquake

Although its origins are uncertain, Aso Shrine (阿蘇神社, Aso Jinja) is believed to date back almost two thousand years to the end of the [Yayoi Period](e2131.html) (300 BC to 300 AD). It has been considered the most important [shrine](e2059.html) in Higo Province, present day [Kumamoto Prefecture](/list/e1244.html).

The shrine's most impressive feature is its two-story **Romon Gate**, one of the largest of its kind in Japan. Behind the gate visitors will come upon the **Haiden**, the shrine's offering hall. Twelve deities are enshrined at Aso Shrine, including one god who is believed to have created the [Aso](e4550.html) area. The shrine also has a pine tree that is believed to give good fortune for marriage.

On April 16, 2016, the celebrated Romon Gate and the offering hall collapsed in an earthquake, and many more structures were damaged. The reconstruction works lasted 7.5 years and were completed in December 2023 when reconstruction works on the Romon Gate ended.

Aso Shrine is about a 20 minute walk north from Miyaji Station on the JR Hohi Line (5 minutes, 240 yen from Aso Station, departures about once an hour).
