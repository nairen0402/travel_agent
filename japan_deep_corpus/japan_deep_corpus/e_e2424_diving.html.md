Going to a beach diving experience on Miyako Island

An island country stretching from the subtropic to the subarctic zone, Japan offers a large number of diverse diving opportunities from coral reefs to ship wrecks, schools of manta rays and hammerhead sharks, [volcanic](e2327.html) terrain and even [drift ice](e2269.html) diving.

Japan's most popular diving destination are the southern islands of [Okinawa](/list/e1247.html), including [Miyako](e7300.html), [Ishigaki](e7201.html), [Iriomote](e7225.html), [Yonaguni](e7275.html) and the [Kerama Islands](e7190.html), where water temperatures are pleasant from April to November and the seas are particularly colorful. But diving is also possible in Japan's more northern latitudes, although the main season there is usually limited to the summer months. Destinations include [Miyazaki](/list/e1245.html), [Kochi](/list/e1236.html), the [Izu Peninsula](e6310.html) and the [Izu Islands](e8252.html).

Divers on an introductory dive

Joining a tour is the easiest and most common way to enjoy diving in Japan. Dive tour companies typically offer introductory diving, fun diving as well as diving certification courses. While dive shops catering to English-speaking tourists are not uncommon in [Okinawa](/list/e1247.html), they can be more difficult to find in the rest of Japan. A wide array of diving activities can be booked online through reservation websites, such as [Klook](https://www.klook.com/search/result/?query=diving%20japan&aid=12675).

Both beach and boat dives are available. Boat tours are the more common of the two as it is more convenient to move between dive sites, but they are also slightly more expensive. Gear rental is almost always available, and participants need to bring only their towels, change of clothes, insurance card and diver's license if applicable.

Introductory **experience dives** do not require a diving license. Introductory dives usually reach depths of no more than ten meters and typically have a ratio of one instructor to two participants. The cost for a single introductory dive starts from around 10,000 yen, including all the diving gear. The actual dive typically lasts for around 20 to 60 minutes.

Those with a diving license can participate in **fun dives**. Single dives typically cost around 8000 yen, two dives around 15,000 yen and three dives around 20,000 yen. Night diving and private tours are also offered at higher rates. While the cost for fun dives usually includes the oxygen tank and weights, a separate rental fee of a few thousand yen is often charged for wetsuits, masks, snorkels, fins and regulator kits.
