### Assessment

The pass pays off for a return trip to one of the locations far outside of central [Sendai](e5150.html) or for a return trip to one of the closer locations (e.g. [Matsushima](e5100.html)) in addition to a couple of subway rides within the city. In particular, the pass is good value for those who visit [Yamadera](e7940.html) in a side trip from Sendai. The pass does not pay off for getting around central Sendai alone.
