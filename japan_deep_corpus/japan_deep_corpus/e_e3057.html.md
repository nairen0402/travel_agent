Since the late 1950s, skyscrapers and towers have sprung up across [Tokyo](e2164.html). The panoramic views that these buildings afford were not lost on the designers, and several of these structures incorporate observation decks that are open to the public. From these enclosed or open-air observatories visitors can look out over the [Kanto Plain](/list/e1103.html) and see as far away as [Mount Fuji](e2172.html) on clear days. The following are some of the best observation decks in Tokyo:

  Opened in 1978 in [Ikebukuro](e3038.html), the 240 meter tall Sunshine 60 was Japan's tallest building for more than a decade. It features an observation deck on its top floor with nice views over the city but is not as centrally located as the above listed observation decks.

Observation decks are not the only way to enjoy views of the city from high up in the air. Several skyscrapers house **restaurants on their top floors** from where diners can simultaneously enjoy good food and good views of the city. Top floor restaurants are an especially good way of seeing the city views at night after other observation decks close. Some notable districts where top floor restaurants are common include [Marunouchi](e3037.html), [Shiodome](e3030.html), [Shinjuku](e3011.html) and [Shibuya](e3007.html).

Furthermore, many of [Tokyo](e2164.html)'s high level [hotels](/hotels/tokyo.html) are also located on the top floors of skyscrapers, allowing them to give their guests exclusive views of the city. Some of these include the [Park Hyatt](https://www.booking.com/hotel/jp/park-hyatt-tokyo.html?aid=355588), [Ritz Carlton](https://www.booking.com/hotel/jp/the-ritz-carlton-tokyo.html?aid=371183), [Mandarin Oriental](https://www.booking.com/hotel/jp/mandarin-oriental-tokyo.html?aid=371183), [Park Hotel Tokyo](https://www.booking.com/hotel/jp/park-tokyo.html?aid=371183) and [Shangri La](https://www.booking.com/hotel/jp/shangri-la-tokyo.html?aid=371183).
