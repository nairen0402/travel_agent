The Hokkaido Shinkansen (北海道新幹線) is a [shinkansen](e2018.html) line that connects [Aomori](e3750.html) on Japan's main island of Honshu with [Hakodate](e5350.html) on the island of [Hokkaido](/list/e1101.html) via the Seikan Tunnel. It is operated by the Hokkaido Railway Company, commonly known as JR Hokkaido. The Hokkaido Shinkansen is scheduled to be extended to [Sapporo](e2163.html) in the late 2030s.

Most trains along the Hokkaido Shinkansen provide through-service with the [Tohoku Shinkansen](e2018_tohoku.html), i.e. they operate all the way between [Tokyo](e2164.html) and [Hakodate](e5350.html). The fastest trains complete the one way journey in about four hours. Note that Hakodate's terminal station, Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto, is located far outside of central Hakodate. A relay train service provides access to/from Hakodate Station in the city center in 20 minutes.

Most trains along the Hokkaido Shinkansen are **Hayabusa** trains that operate all the way between [Tokyo](e2164.html) and [Hakodate](e5350.html). The Hayabusa is one of the few shinkansen trains without non-reserved seating. A seat reservation is mandatory. When all seats are booked out, standing tickets can be purchased. Besides ordinary seats (3x2 seats per row) and a Green Car (2x2 seats per row), the Hayabusa carries one Gran Class car, the first class service by JR with 2x1 seats per row.

Note: For simplification, some rare train compositions and stopping patterns are omitted.
