The Yokokan Garden (養浩館庭園, Yōkōkan Teien) is a [landscape garden](e2099.html) in central [Fukui City](e6600.html) with a central pond and a [sukiya](e2007.html)-style villa. Located a few hundred meters from the former site of Fukui Castle's inner ward, the garden served the enjoyment of the local lords who ruled [Echizen Province](/list/e1223.html) during the [Edo Period](e2128.html) (1603-1868).

The garden features many of the [classic garden elements](e2099_elements.html), including a shallow pond, a stone bridge, seasonal plants and large stones, some taken from the [Tojinbo Cliffs](e6604.html), but the highlight is the outstandingly beautiful villa which appears to be floating on the pond.

The villa's interior is divided into several rooms, including the lord's room, moon viewing room, and a bathroom complete with cedar bathtub. The buildings were destroyed in the air raids of [World War 2](e2129.html), but were rebuilt in the 1990s based on their mid-[Edo Period](e2128.html) appearance.

Today, all of the villa's rooms are open to visitors, who can enjoy pleasant views directly over the surface of the pond from the open veranda.
