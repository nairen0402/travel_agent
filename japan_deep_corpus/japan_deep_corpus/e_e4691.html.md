[Amami Oshima](e4690.html) is a relatively large island, and it takes around two hours to drive from top to bottom. The island's largest town is **Amami City** (also referred to as Naze), located on the northern coast near the center of the island. This is where [ferries](e2355.html) from [Kagoshima](e4600.html) and [Okinawa](e7101.html) arrive.

**Amami Airport** is located in the northeast corner of the island, a 45 minute car ride or 60 minute [bus](e2015.html) ride (1100 yen one way) from central Amami City. Near the island's southern tip lies another larger town, named **Setouchi** (also referred to as Koniya). A main road connects the airport with Amami City and Setouchi and serves as the main artery of Amami Oshima.

Another main road connects Amami City and Setouchi along the west coast; however, note that this road is convoluted and much slower. The entire island is very hilly, especially the center and south. Consequently, there are many tunnels along the roads.

The most convenient way to get around Amami Oshima is by **rental car** because public transportation is infrequent and in some places nonexistent. [Rental cars](e2024.html) are available from outlets at Amami Airport and in central Amami City.

Public transportation is provided by the **Shimabus** ("island bus"). There are around ten [bus](e2015.html) routes that converge in central Amami City and splinter off to other parts of the island. Buses operate every 30 minutes between the airport and central Amami City, and about every 90 minutes between Amami City and Setouchi, but much less frequently elsewhere.

Bus fares depend on distance travelled. Alternatively, there are 1-day, 2-day and 3-day passes for unlimited travel available for 2400, 3600 and 4800 yen respectively. They can be purchased at Amami Airport, the Shimabus counter in downtown Amami City and Amami City Port.
