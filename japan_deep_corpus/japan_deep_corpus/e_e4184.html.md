The Archaeological Institute of Kashihara and Mount Unebi in the background

The Archaeological Institute of Kashihara (奈良県立橿原考古学研究所, Narakenritsu Kashihara Kōkogaku Kenkyūsho) was established by the [Nara](/list/e1228.html) prefectural government to study and safeguard the many archaeological sites found within the prefecture. For instance, the institute was involved in the excavation of the [Takamatsuzuka Tomb](e4178.html) in the 1970s. Located at the base of Mount Unebi, one of the three [Yamato mountains](e4182.html), the institute also contains a museum.

The Institute's museum has three main exhibition rooms. The first room covers the [Jomon Period](e2131.html) (13,000 BC to 300 BC) and the [Yayoi Period](e2131.html) (300 BC to 300 AD), the second room covers the [Kofun Period](e2131.html) (300-538), and the third room covers a large stretch of time from the [Asuka Period](e2131.html) (538-710) to the [Muromachi Period](e2134.html) (1338-1573). The museum displays a number of informative maps and dioramas in addition to the archaeological artefacts.

The Archaeological Institute of Kashihara is located a five minute walk from Unebigoryo-mae Station. The museum can also be reached in a 15 minute walk or five minute [bicycle](e2210.html) ride from Kashiharajingu-mae Station.
