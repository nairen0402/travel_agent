Toyosu Market (豊洲市場, Toyosu Shijō) [opened in October 2018](/blog/schauwecker/181015.html) on the man-made island of [Toyosu](e3013.html) in the Bay of [Tokyo](e2164.html). It took over the wholesale business from the aging [Tsukiji Market](e3021.html) and provides tourists with an opportunity to observe the [market](e2452.html) action and to [dine](e620.html) at [restaurants](e2036.html) across its large, modern premises.

The huge wholesale market consists of three main buildings: two buildings for seafood and one for [fruits](e2347.html) and [vegetables](e2346.html). All buildings are connected with each other and Shijo-mae Station via walkways, and tourists can enter them along dedicated routes and view the action from observation windows that look onto the auction and wholesale halls for seafood and produce.

### Fish Wholesale Market Building

This is the building where the tuna auctions take place between around 5:30 and 6:30 in the mornings. It consists of two main halls: the hall for tuna auctions and the hall where seafood other than tuna is auctioned. For tourists, the building complex houses a small restaurant area and many windows and an observation deck to view the auctions:

* 

  Tuna Auction Observation Windows

  Several windows along a corridor allow visitors to watch down onto the action of the tuna auctions. The windows are double-glazed and keep the observation area mild around the year. However, they also block off all the market sounds and make it a little challenging to take photos without reflections.
* 

  Tuna Auction Observation Deck

  This observation platform on a lower floor is separated from the action by only a single piece of glass and is also exposed to the noise and temperature of the auction hall. An [advance reservation](https://toyosu.jcdlotterysite.jp/?lng=2) is required to access this deck during the tuna auctions. Applications for dates for a given month can be [submitted](https://toyosu.jcdlotterysite.jp/?lng=2) during a selected time period in the previous month (typically during about ten days until around the middle of the month). Participants will be decided by lottery and informed a few days after the submission deadline.
* 

  Seafood Auction Observation Windows

  A few windows also look into the auction hall where seafood other than tuna is auctioned. While the floor in the tuna auction hall is colored green to provide an ideal contrast for buyers to inspect the tuna, the floor in the seafood auction hall is kept grey.

### Fish Intermediate Wholesale Market Building

This is the building where the many wholesale businesses have their shops and sell seafood to licensed buyers. The wholesale market is off-limit to regular visitors, however the building offers tourists several attractions on its upper floors:

* 

  Restaurant Area

  This is the largest of three [restaurant](e2036.html) areas found at the market. Many restaurants that were formerly located in [Tsukiji](e3021.html)'s inner market moved to and reopened at Toyosu Market, including some very popular [sushi](e2038.html) restaurants.
* 

  Wholesale Market Observation Windows

  The wholesale market is off-limit to tourists; however, there are a few windows that look down onto the market floor, providing some rather limited views of the market action.
* 

  Uogashi Yokocho Market

  Unlike the wholesale market, the Uogashi Yokocho Market is a shopping area open not only to market workers but also to the general public. Here, over 70 shops sell non-perishable goods and processed foods in retail portions, including knives, [pickles](e2349.html), [tea](e2041.html) and souvenirs.
* 

  Rooftop Garden

  A spacious rooftop garden sits on top of the building, providing lawn space and pretty views onto the waterfront of Tokyo Bay.

### Fruit and Vegetable Market Building

This building combines the auction hall and the wholesale market for fresh [fruits](e2347.html) and [vegetables](e2346.html). Visitors are able to observe the action from windows on the upper floor. A small cluster of restaurants is, furthermore, located, near the entrance of the building:

* 

  Wholesale Market Observation Windows

  A long corridor with over a dozen windows provides visitors with views into the many small wholesale shops of the market.
* 

  Auction Observation Windows

  A large observation deck with big windows looks down into the huge hall where the fresh produce is auctioned off in the mornings. The auctions start from around 6:30.

A facility for additional [shopping](e2450.html) and [dining](e620.html), targeting visitors and tourists, opened in February 2024 just next to the market. Known as **Senkyaku Banrai**, the nicely designed facility also contains a [public bath](e2292.html) and spa, which offers overnight options.

Tuna Auctions

Toyosu Market surrounds Shijo-mae Station on the Yurikamome. The Yurikamome is an automated, elevated train with rubber tires which connects Shimbashi Station on the [JR Yamanote Line](e2370.html) via [Odaiba](e3008.html) with Toyosu Station. The waterfront area of Tokyo is also one of the city's few areas where access by [bus](e2015.html) can be worth considering.

Note that two hotels, the [Hotel JAL City Tokyo Toyosu](https://www.booking.com/hotel/jp/hotel-jal-city-tokyo-toyosu.html?aid=355588) and the [La Vista Tokyo Bay](https://www.booking.com/hotel/jp/rabisutadong-jing-bei.html?aid=355588), are located just a few steps from the market, allowing for convenient early-morning visits.

### By train from Tokyo Station

Take the JR Yamanote Line one station from [Tokyo Station](e3037.html) to [Yurakucho](e3072.html) (1 minute, 150 yen). From Yurakucho, take the Yurakucho Subway Line to [Toyosu](e3013.html) (8 minutes, 180 yen). Finally, take the Yurikamome to Shijo-mae Station in the center of Toyosu Market (4 minutes, 190 yen). The first connection in the morning arrives at the market around 5:20.

### By bus from Shimbashi Station

"Tokyo BRT" (bus rapid transit) operates roughly three buses per hour between Shimbashi Station on the [Yamanote Line](e2370.html) and Toyosu Market (10 minutes, 220 yen one way); however, the first bus does not depart until after 6am. Alternatively, take bus line 市01, which operates between Shimbashi and the market every 10-15 minutes from 5am to 9am and less frequently afterwards. These buses take about 25 minutes for the journey, cost 210 yen one way, and do not run on Sundays and [national holidays](e2062.html).

### By bus from Tokyo Station

Toei bus line 都05-2 runs every 10-20 minutes from the Marunouchi side of [Tokyo Station](e3037.html) to Tokyo Big Sight, stopping along the way at Shin-Toyosu Station near Toyosu Market (25 minutes, 210 yen one way); however, buses do not operate before 7am.
