Megaliths combines digital art with living moss

teamLab Biovortex Kyoto is a digital art museum in [Kyoto](e2158.html), which opened in October 2025, about a ten minute walk southwest of [Kyoto Station](e3922.html). The museum features over 50 artworks designed to immerse visitors in a world that transcends physical boundaries.

Spread across four floors and covering over 10,000 square meters, the museum offers mostly dark exhibition spaces illuminated by dynamic lights and interactive digital installations. It is easy to spend several hours exploring the maze-like museum. While some of the artworks are also displayed at other teamLab museums, a few pieces made their debut in Kyoto.
