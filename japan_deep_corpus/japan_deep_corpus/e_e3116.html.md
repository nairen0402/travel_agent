  This hill top park, which was the site of various historical events during the [Kamakura Period](e2133.html) and features a statue of [Minamoto Yoritomo](e2133.html), offers several dozens of cherry trees in multiple park areas that are well suited for hanami picnics.

  5-10 minutes from Hase Station

  The number of cherry trees on the grounds of Kotokuin Temple, the home of Kamakura's famous [Great Buddha](e3100.html), is not very large. But one well placed tree to the right of the Daibutsu lets visitors beautifully combine the statue with cherry blossoms into photos.
