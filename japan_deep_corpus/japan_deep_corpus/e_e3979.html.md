Koshoji Temple (興聖寺, Kōshōji) is relatively new by [Uji](e3975.html)'s standards. Originally built in 1233 at a different location in [Kyoto](e2158.html), the temple was moved to Uji in 1648. The [temple](e2058.html) has a nice garden in its open court, with a five storied stone pagoda and carefully pruned trees and bushes.

Koshoji is a working [Zen](e2055.html) temple and is well known for its impressive [fall colors](e2014.html). The approach up to Koshoji is lined with maple trees that create a tunnel of color around late November.

Koshoji Temple is located on the northern bank of [Uji River](e3980.html). From JR Uji Station, the temple is about a 20-25 minute walk across the river. From [Byodoin Temple](e3923.html), it is a ten minute walk across Uji River.
