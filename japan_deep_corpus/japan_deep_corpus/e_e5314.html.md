The entrance to Sapporo Factory's red brick Akarenga building

Sapporo Factory is a large shopping and entertainment complex that was opened in 1993 in central [Sapporo](e2163.html). There are about 160 establishments that include clothing stores, souvenir shops, restaurants, cafes and a multi-screen movie theater. The shops are concentrated around a five story atrium that provides visitors a refreshing and spacious atmosphere.

Sapporo Factory was constructed on the former site of Japan's first [beer](e2037_beer.html) brewery, and the complex includes a red brick **Akarenga** building that is reminiscent of [Hokkaido](/list/e1101.html)'s early development in the late 1800s. A small, functioning brewery can be observed within the building, and the beer enjoyed at the Akarenga's beer hall or tasting bar.
