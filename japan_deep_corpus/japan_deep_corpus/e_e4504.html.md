Important Notice:

The Former Hosokawa Residence suffered damage in the [earthquakes of April 2016](/news/0035.html) and remains closed to the public until further notice.

The Former Hosokawa Residence (旧細川刑部邸, Kyū Hosokawa Gyōbutei) is the former residence of a branch family of the Hosokawa Clan, the powerful clan that ruled over [Kumamoto](e4500.html) during most of the [Edo Period](e2128.html) (1603-1868). The building is a great example of a high-class [samurai](e2127.html) mansion.

After the end of the feudal era, Gyobutei was moved to a different location in 1873, but was re-located to [Kumamoto Castle Park](e4501.html) and beautifully restored in the 1990s. It unfortunately suffered damage in the [2016 earthquakes](/news/0035.html) and is currently closed to the public indefinitely. Repair works on the building have started, and - although nothing has been decided yet - there are hopes that the residence will reopen by 2030.

The Former Hosokawa Residence is located in the north of [Kumamoto Castle Park](e4501.html), a ten minute walk from the castle tower.
