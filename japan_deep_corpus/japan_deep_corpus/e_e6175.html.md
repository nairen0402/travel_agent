Iwakuni (岩国), a small city of 150,000 people in southeastern [Yamaguchi Prefecture](/list/e1239.html), is best known for its unique [Kintai-kyo Bridge](e6177.html). Beautiful around the year, the bridge is particularly attractive during the [cherry blossom](e2011.html) season, which usually takes place in early April.

During the [Edo Period](e2128.html), Iwakuni used to be one of the feudal domains of Japan. Its former mountain-top [castle](e6178.html) was reconstructed in the 1960s and counts to the city's other tourist attractions. Iwakuni is easily visited as a side trip from [Hiroshima](e2160.html).
