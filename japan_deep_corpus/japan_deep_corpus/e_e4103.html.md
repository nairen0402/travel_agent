Nara Park (奈良公園, Nara Kōen) is a large park in central [Nara](e2165.html). Established in 1880, it is the location of many of Nara's main attractions including [Todaiji](e4100.html), [Kasuga Taisha](e4102.html), [Kofukuji](e4101.html) and the [Nara National Museum](e4109.html). It is also home to hundreds of freely roaming deer.

Considered the messengers of the [gods](e2056.html), Nara's over 1000 deer have become a symbol of the city and have even been designated as a natural treasure. Deer crackers are for sale around the park, and some deer have learned to bow to visitors to ask to be fed. Nara's deer are surprisingly tame, although they can be aggressive if they think you will feed them, so make sure not to tease them with food.

Nara Park is a five minute walk from Kintetsu Nara Station or about a 20 minute walk from JR Nara Station. Alternatively, the park can be reached by [bus](e2015.html). There are multiple stops around the park.
