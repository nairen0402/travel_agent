Lake Saiko (西湖) is smaller and much less developed than neighboring [Lake Kawaguchiko](e6906.html). The views of [Mount Fuji](e2172.html) from Lake Saiko's shores are blocked by other mountains, except at the lake's western end from where there are beautiful, full views of the volcano.

Lake Saiko is surrounded by wooded mountains and a few camp sites, and is a popular destination for those interested in camping, boating, fishing and other outdoor activities. A network of [hiking](e2427.html) trails covers the mountains surrounding the lake and Aokigahara Jukai, an expansive forest south of the lake, infamous as a suicide spot and for people getting lost.

Several [caves](e6911.html), formed during past eruptions of [Mount Fuji](e2172.html), can be found around Aokigahara Jukai in the vicinity of Lake Saiko. Three of them, the Ice Cave, Wind Cave and Bat Cave, have been developed to be easily accessible to tourists. The area is also known for its [autumn colors](e2014.html) which are usually at their best around the first half of November.

  [Iyashi no Sato](e6923.html)

  See the [Iyashi no Sato page](e6923.html) for admission details

  Iyashi no Sato is a mixture between [open air museum](e2421.html) and craft village, built in the style of a traditional village with thatched roof farmhouses. Visitors can try their hand at or purchase different traditional handicrafts and learn about the local history and traditional lifestyle.
* 

  Koyodai

  Hours: 8:30 to 17:00  
  Closed: When there is a lot of snow  
  Admission: 300 yen

  Koyodai is one of the smaller mountains south of the lake, which is famous for and named after its [autumn colors](e2014.html) (koyo). The Koyodai is accessible in an easy 30 minute hike from the nearest bus stops, and offers excellent views of Mount Fuji from a paid observation deck. It is also accessible by car via an unpaved road.
* 

  Yurari•

  Hours: 10:00 to 21:00 (until 22:00 on weekends and [national holidays](e2062.html))  
  Admission ends 60 minutes before closing  
  Closed: No closing days  
  Admission: 1400 yen (weekdays), 1700 yen (weekends)

  Yurari is a modern, beautifully designed public [hot spring](e2292.html) facility with a variety of gender segregated indoor and outdoor baths. The baths on the second floor have nice views of [Mount Fuji](e2172.html). Private baths with views of the mountain are also available (60 minutes, 3500 yen).
* 

  [Bat Cave](e6911.html)

  See the [cave page](e6911.html) for admission details

  The Bat Cave, named after its former winter inhabitants, is the most extensive of the three caves. In total the cave is nearly 350 meters long and has multiple large chambers and diverging tunnels to be explored. Some of the tunnels come with rather low ceilings.
* 

  [Ice Cave](e6911.html)

  See the [cave page](e6911.html) for admission details

  Even during the summer, the temperature in the Ice Cave usually stays below freezing. Consequently the cave has been used since the early 1900s to store ice for use around the year. The circular walk through this cave is not very long, but contains passages with low ceilings and slippery stairs.
* 

  [Wind Cave](e6911.html)

  See the [cave page](e6911.html) for admission details

  In the past, this cave was used as a natural storehouse and refrigerator, as the temperature inside stays at a relatively constant zero degrees Celsius throughout the year. The cave is furnished with a few shelves that store boxes of acorns and silkworm cocoons. It is the most easily walkable and least exciting of the three caves.

The [Omni Bus Green Line](e6905.html) (or Saiko Line) connects Kawaguchiko Station with Lake Saiko, circles the lake in a clockwise direction and stops at [Iyashi no Sato](e6923.html), at the trailhead to Koyodai and near the [three caves](e6911.html).

Apart from the omni buses, there are a few regular [buses](e2015.html) that operate between Kawaguchiko Station and Lake Saiko. Buses bound for Shin-Fuji and [Lake Motosuko](e6910.html) stop near Yurari Onsen and the ice and wind caves. There is one bus every 1-2 hours, and the bus ride from Kawaguchiko Station takes around 20-30 minutes and costs around 600-700 yen.
