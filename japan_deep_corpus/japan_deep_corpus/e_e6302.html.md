Shimoda Park (下田公園, Shimoda Kōen) is an attractive, wooded park on a hill next to [Shimoda](e6300.html)'s city center. Fortifications for the defense of the city once stood on the hill, but now only ruins remain. Shimoda Park is the site of the [Monument to the Opening of US-Japan Diplomatic Relations](e6301.html) built in 1957 and is home to more than one thousand [hydrangeas](e2423_ajisai.html) (ajisai), which bloom throughout June. From the far side of the park you can get a preview of the wildly rugged coastline of the [southern tip of the Izu Peninsula](e6303.html).

There are several entrances into Shimoda Park, including one at the eastern end of [Perry Road](e6301.html) and one near the Shimoda Aquarium. The main trail through Shimoda Park takes about 30-45 minutes to walk and passes through the hydrangeas and by the historic monuments. In addition, there are a few side trails that lead to lookout points with views out towards the city and along the coast.

The park can be reached in a 20 minute walk from Izukyu-Shimoda Station. Alternatively, take a [bus](e2015.html) from the station bound for the Shimoda Aquarium (海中水族館, Kaichū Suizokukan) and get off at [Ryosenji Temple](e6301.html) (了仙寺, 200 yen one way, hourly), from where it is a 5-10 minute walk to the park entrance. Or stay on the bus all the way to the aquarium (about 7 minutes, 200 yen) from where it is just a few steps to the closest park entrance.
