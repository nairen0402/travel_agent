The Hakone Ropeway (箱根ロ−プウエイ) is part of the [Hakone Round Course](e5210.html), a popular way to visit [Hakone](e5200.html). It connects Sounzan Station (at the terminus of the Hakone Tozan Cablecar) with Togendai Station (at the shore of [Lake Ashinoko](e5201.html)) and stops at [Owakudani](e5203.html) and Ubako stations on the way. The ropeway is fully covered by the [Hakone Free Pass](e2358_008.html).

The ropeway's gondolas depart every minute and fit around ten people each. Traveling the full length of the ropeway takes around 30 minutes. Along the journey, passengers can enjoy views of the active, sulfuric hot spring sources of the [Owakudani Valley](e5203.html) between Sounzan and Owakudani and of [Lake Ashinoko](e5201.html) and [Mount Fuji](e2172.html) between Owakudani and Togendai if visibility allows. A transfer of gondolas is necessary at Owakudani, but no transfer is needed at Ubako.

Sounzan Station at the ropeway's eastern end can be reached in a short cablecar ride from Gora, while Togendai Station at the western end is located next to the pier of the sightseeing boats that cruise [Lake Ashinoko](e5201.html).
