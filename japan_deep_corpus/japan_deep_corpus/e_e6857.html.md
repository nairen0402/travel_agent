The town of Utoro with the Oronko Rock on the right

Utoro (ウトロ) is the largest and only sizable town along the western coast of the [Shiretoko Peninsula](e6850.html). Located at the entrance to the national park, it serves as a transportation hub and is the boarding point for [sightseeing boat tours](e6852.html) up the peninsula's coast.

Utoro is blessed with natural [hot spring](e2292.html) water and offers a range of accommodation from simple [minshuku](e2026.html) to large onsen [ryokan](e2029.html). While the town's coastal area retains the atmosphere of a small fishing village, a short walk up the hill brings you into the hot spring area where the numerous, large onsen ryokan are located.

Several large rocks stand along the shores of Utoro. The most spectacular of them is the 60 meters high **Oronko Rock** next to the harbor. A small path leads up to the top of the rock (closed in winter), from where you can enjoy nice views of the town and coast.

### By car

Utoro is located about 40 kilometers from the town center of Shari along Route 334. Alternatively, it is about 30 kilometers from Rausu via [Shiretoko Pass](e6858.html) (closed in winter).

### By bus

Utoro is connected by infrequent [buses](e2015.html) with JR Shiretoko Shari Station (50 minutes, 1650 yen one way). A small number of direct buses run between Utoro and Memanbetsu Airport during summer (mid June to early October), [Golden Week](e2282.html) and winter (mid January to early March). The one way ride from the airport takes about two hours and costs 3500 yen.
