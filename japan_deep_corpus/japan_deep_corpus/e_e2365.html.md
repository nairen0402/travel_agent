### Airports

Tokyo's [Haneda Airport](e2430.html) is by far Japan's busiest airport, handling most of the capital's domestic flights and an increasing number of international flights. Tokyo's [Narita Airport](e2027.html) handles mostly international flights and an increasing number of domestic low-cost flights.

Osaka's [Kansai Airport](e2033.html) serves both, international and domestic flights. It took over a large share of traffic (mainly international) formerly handled by Osaka's second airport, [Itami Airport](e2433.html). Nevertheless, Itami Airport remains a busy hub for domestic air traffic.

Other major airports in Japan include [Nagoya](e2155.html)'s [Central Japan Airport](e2431.html), [Sapporo](e2163.html)'s [Shin-Chitose Airport](e2435.html), [Fukuoka Airport](e2436.html), [Kobe Airport](e2432.html), Kagoshima Airport and [Okinawa](/list/e1247.html)'s Naha Airport. A few other important airports are shown on the map below:

### Airfares

Thanks to the deregulation of Japan's airline industry and increasing competition from discount airlines, domestic airfares have dropped dramatically in the 2010s, and airplanes have become an economical alternative to the [shinkansen](e2018.html) on some routes.

While regular fares remain relatively expensive, it is the low-cost carriers and the many [discount offers](e2364.html), which have made domestic air travel in Japan more attractive. Please visit the [Discount Air Ticket](e2364.html) page for more details.
