The Kyushu Shinkansen (九州新幹線, Kyūshū Shinkansen) is a [shinkansen](e2018.html) line, which connects [Fukuoka](e2161.html) (Hakata Station) in the north with [Kagoshima](e4600.html) (Kagoshima-Chuo Station) in the south of [Kyushu](/list/e1108.html). The southern half was opened in 2004 and the northern half in 2011. A branch line to [Nagasaki](e2162.html), the [Nishikyushu Shinkansen](e2018_nishikyushu.html), partially opened in September 2022.

Most trains along the Kyushu Shinkansen provide through service with the [Sanyo Shinkansen](e2018_sanyo.html) to/from [Osaka](e2157.html) or provide a quick and easy transfer to/from a Nozomi train at Hakata Station. Trains along the Kyushu Shinkansen are operated by the Kyushu Railway Company, commonly known as JR Kyushu.

Three train categories operate on the Kyushu Shinkansen:

The **Mizuho** is the fastest train category, stopping only at [Hakata](e2161.html), [Kumamoto](e4500.html) and [Kagoshima](e4700.html)-Chuo. It provides through service to the [Sanyo Shinkansen](e2018_sanyo.html) to/from [Osaka](e2157.html). There are only a few round trips per day, mainly in the mornings, late afternoons and evenings. The Mizuho is one of the few JR trains that require a supplement fee for [Japan Rail Pass](e2361.html) holders. However, the Mizuho is fully covered by the [Kyushu Rail Pass](e2361_05.html) (between Hakata and Kagoshima-Chuo).

The **Sakura** is the second fastest train category along the Kyushu Shinkansen, serving a few more stations than the Mizuho. There is usually one departure per hour, with some providing through service to the [Sanyo Shinkansen](e2018_sanyo.html) to/from [Osaka](e2157.html).

Two types of train sets are used as Sakura trains. The 8-car sets have Green Car seats in only half of car number 6, while reserved seating comes in rows of 2x2 seats (which are almost as comfortable as the Green Car seats) and non-reserved seating with rows of 3x2 seats. The 6-car sets have no Green Car, but all seating comes in rows of 2x2 seats.

The **Tsubame** is the slowest train category along the Kyushu Shinkansen, stopping at all stations along the way. Most trains operate only between [Hakata](e2161.html) and [Kumamoto](e4500.html), and only a few as far as [Kagoshima](e4600.html). Most Tsubame use 6-car train sets that do not have a Green Car, but come with seats in rows of 2x2 seats, which are almost as comfortable as Green Car seats.

Note: For simplification, some rare train compositions and stopping patterns are omitted.
