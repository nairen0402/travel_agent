The center of the former Ryukyu Kingdom, Okinawa Main Island (沖縄本島, Okinawa Hontō) is by far the largest and most populous island in [Okinawa Prefecture](/list/e1247.html). The prefectural capital [Naha](e7102.html) and most of the US military bases are located here.

While much of the central part of Okinawa Honto is urbanized, the southern tip and the northern third of the island are less densely populated, while the northernmost [Yanbaru Region](e7131.html) remains mainly covered by forested hills and small fishing and farming villages.
