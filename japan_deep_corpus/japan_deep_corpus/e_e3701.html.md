During the [Edo Period](e2128.html) (1603-1868), Hirosaki (弘前) was the political and cultural capital of the Tsugaru Region, the western section of present day [Aomori Prefecture](/list/e1202.html). The city remains one of the culturally richest cities in the northern [Tohoku Region](/list/e1102.html).

Hirosaki developed around [Hirosaki Castle](e3700.html). Thousands of [cherry trees](e2011.html) are planted around the castle grounds, turning them into one of Japan's most spectacular [cherry blossom spots](e2011_where.html) typically from late April to early May. The city is also famous for the Tsugaru-jamisen, a local version of the shamisen. The music instrument can be seen in action at some restaurants that offer live performances.
