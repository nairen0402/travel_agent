Yume Kyobashi Castle Road (夢京橋キャッスルロード, Yume Kyōbashi Castle Road) is a road just outside [Hikone Castle](e7001.html)'s outer moat, which has been redesigned in a style combining the look and atmosphere of a former [castle town](e2296.html) with a pleasant, modern [shopping](e2450.html) street.

To achieve the castle town look, the buildings along the road have been designed like town houses from the [Edo Period](e2128.html) (1603-1868) with white walls, blackened roofs and lattice doors. Various boutiques, restaurants, cafes and souvenir shops line the street, which makes for a pleasant stroll after a visit to the [castle](e7001.html).

The Yume Kyobashi Castle Road starts at the Kyobashi Bridge, which leads over the outer moat, southwest of [Hikone Castle](e7001.html), a 20 minute walk from the station.
