Higashiyama Onsen (東山温泉) is a [hot spring](e2292.html) resort in a valley just east of the downtown area of [Aizu Wakamatsu](e7700.html). There are quite a few large hotels and some shops for visitors. Although the hot baths may be relaxing and the surrounding valley beautiful, the area seems a bit worn down and overdeveloped.

However, one particularly notable [ryokan](e2029.html) in the area is the Mukaitaki Ryokan, which - contrasting with some of the surrounding concrete hotels - is a traditional, wooden construction. It is one of the best and most atmospheric onsen ryokan in all of Japan.

Higashiyama Onsen is served by the [Aizu Loop Bus](e7701.html) (35 minutes from Aizu-Wakamatsu Station), except around lunch when most buses go only as far as the [Aizu Bukeyashiki](e7707.html), from where the hot spring resort can be reached in a 10-15 minute walk.
