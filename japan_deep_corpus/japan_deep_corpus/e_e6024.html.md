One of Yudanaka Onsen's main streets, just beside the train station

Yudanaka Onsen (湯田中温泉) has a long history as a [hot spring resort](e2292.html), dating back hundreds of years like the neighboring [Shibu Onsen](e6029.html). However, Yudanaka has seen more development, giving it a more modern atmosphere than Shibu Onsen. The atmosphere becomes more traditional as one walks upwards from the bottom of the gently sloping town, where the Yudanaka train station is located.

Yudanaka Station is the last stop along the Nagaden Railway, so people traveling by train will first arrive in Yudanaka before exploring the rest of the [Yamanouchi](e6025.html) area. Right inside the station is the Kaede no Yu [public bath](e2074.html), allowing visitors to start enjoying the area's hot spring water immediately upon arrival. There is a free footbath located just outside the station for travelers not quite ready to completely submerge in the water.

Near the top of the town and accessed by a flight of 112 steps is the Sekai Heiwa Kannon. The main feature of the [temple](e2058.html) is its 25 meter tall bronze statue of Kannon, the goddess of mercy, which overlooks the town of Yudanaka. There are a couple more statues of Kannon in the main hall as well as in the annex at the base of the large statue representing the temples along the Saigoku 33 temple pilgrimage route in the [Kansai Region](/list/e1105.html).

Yudanaka Onsen is the main entry point to the [Yamanouchi](e6025.html) area. It is the final stop of the Nagaden Railway Line from Nagano Station (70 minutes, 1190 yen by local train or 45 minutes, 1290 yen with unreserved seat or 1590 yen with reserved seat on a [limited express](e2016.html#category) train).
