Daishizan Seidaiji Temple (大師山清大寺) in Katsuyama City, not far from the [Dinosaur Museum](e6602.html) and [Heisenji Hakusan Shrine](e6608.html), is a [temple](e2058.html) of immense dimensions, featuring Japan's largest indoor Buddha statue, tallest five-story pagoda and a huge temple hall. It is modeled after the great [Todaiji Temple](e4100.html) in [Nara](e2165.html) and was built in the 1980s by the owner of a local taxi company, albeit on an even greater scale and in ferro-concrete rather than wood.

The surreal visit starts with a walk along the shop-lined temple approach. After entering the paid area, visitors make their way towards the gigantic main hall along a broad, gently sloped path that leads past two temple gates.

Inside the main hall stands the 17 meter tall, bronze **Echizen Great Buddha** (越前大仏, Echizen Daibutsu), which is said to be the largest Buddha statue in Japan housed under a roof and named after Echizen Province, the old name of [Fukui Prefecture](/list/e1223.html). Its design is inspired by the seated Buddha carving at the Longmen Grottoes in China. It is flanked by four standing Bodhisattva statues. The walls behind and to either side are lined with over a thousand smaller stone statues, adding to the sense of scale and atmosphere.

The temple's other main highlight is its five-story pagoda, at 75 meters the tallest of its kind in Japan. Visitors can ascend the pagoda by elevator and take in an impressive panorama of the temple grounds and surrounding landscape. Additionally, visitors can view a reproduced Wall of Nine Dragons from China and a small [strolling garden](e2099.html) with pond.

Due to infrequent public transport, the Great Buddha of Echizen is easiest to access by [car](e2024.html). The journey takes about 40 minutes from central [Fukui City](e6600.html) or about 10 minutes from the [Fukui Dinosaur Museum](e6602.html). Free parking is available.

If you do not have a car, take the Echizen Railway Katsuyama Eiheiji Line from Fukui Station to Katsuyama Station (55 minutes, 820 yen one way, every 30 minutes) and transfer to a highly infrequent community bus along the Heisenji Line to Echizen Daibutsu-mae bus stop (20 minutes, 100 yen, every 3-4 hours). During weekends and holidays outside of winter, infrequent "Dinogon" tourist buses additionally connect the temple with Katsuyama Station, the [dinosaur museum](e6602.html) and [Heisenji Hakusan Shrine](e6608.html) for 300 yen per ride. Alternatively, a [taxi](e2021.html) ride from the station to the temple costs around 1500 yen one way.
