Main Hall

Zuisenji (瑞泉寺) is a beautiful [Zen](e2055.html) temple in the far east of Kamakura, in the back of a narrow valley and surrounded by wooded hills. It is a branch [temple](e2058.html) of the [Engakuji Temple](e3103.html).

Zuisenji was founded by Muso Kokushi, a leading Zen master and one of Japan's most famous [garden](e2099.html) designers. The temple is known for its rock garden behind the temple's main hall, designed by Muso himself. The temple also attracts with its many flowers and blooming trees in the other parts of the temple grounds, including a large number of [plum trees](e2013.html).
