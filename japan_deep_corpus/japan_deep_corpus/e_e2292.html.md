Natural hot springs (温泉, onsen) are numerous and highly popular across Japan. Every region of the country has its share of hot springs and resort towns, which come with them.

There are many [types of hot springs](e2292_water.html), distinguished by the minerals dissolved in the water. Different minerals provide different health benefits, and all hot springs are supposed to have a relaxing effect on your body and mind. Hot spring baths come in [many varieties](e2292_types.html), indoors and outdoors, traditional and modern. Hot spring baths can be enjoyed at [ryokan](e2029.html), hotels and [public bath houses](e2074.html). An [overnight stay at an onsen ryokan](e2292_ryokan.html), in particular, is a highly recommended experience to any visitor of Japan.
