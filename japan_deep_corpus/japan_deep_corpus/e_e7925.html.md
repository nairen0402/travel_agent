Mount Zao (蔵王山, Zaōsan) is a [volcanic](e2327.html) mountain range on the prefectural border between [Yamagata](/list/e1205.html) and [Miyagi](/list/e1206.html) Prefectures in the [Tohoku Region](/list/e1102.html). On the Yamagata side, the [hot spring](e2292.html) town of [Zao Onsen](e7928.html) offers some of the country's most acidic thermal waters.

In summer, the mountain attracts nature lovers with its spectacular [Okama Crater](e7929.html), while in winter, Zao Onsen turns into a leading [ski resort](e7927.html) and one of only few places in Japan to see "snow monsters" (frozen trees).
