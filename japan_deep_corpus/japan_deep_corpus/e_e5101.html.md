For hundreds of years, Matsushima Bay (松島湾, Matsushima-wan) has been celebrated as one of [Japan's three most scenic views](e2250.html) alongside [Miyajima](e3401.html) and [Amanohashidate](e3990.html). The bay is dotted by over 200 small islands covered by pine trees.

A good way to enjoy the bay is by sightseeing cruise. Multiple companies offer various courses, including circular cruises starting and ending at [Matsushima](e5100.html) and cruises that connect Matsushima with nearby [Shiogama](e5041.html). Cruises last around 50 minutes and cost around 1500 yen. First class seats are available for an additional few hundred yen.

Views from a sightseeing cruise

Cruises depart from Matsushima Pier, a 5-10 minute walk from Matsushima Kaigan Station on the JR Senseki Line, and from Shiogama Pier ([Marine Gate Shiogama](e5041.html)), a 5-10 minute walk from Hon-Shiogama Station, three stations ahead of Matsushima Kaigan Station on the same line.

A popular route is taking the Senseki Line from [Sendai](e5150.html) to [Shiogama](e5041.html), then a cruise to [Matsushima](e5100.html), before returning to Sendai by train (or the other way around).
