The Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum (江戸東京たてもの園, Edo Tōkyō Tatemono-en) is an [open air museum](e2421.html) in the western suburbs of [Tokyo](e2164.html), which exhibits a range of historic buildings from the Tokyo area. The buildings were relocated or reconstructed here in order to preserve a chapter of [architectural](e2111.html) history, which has been almost completely lost in fires, [earthquakes](e2116.html), wars and city redevelopment.

Most of the buildings exhibited are from the [Meiji Period](e2130.html) (1868-1912) or more recent times and include - among others - a politician's elegant former residence, a farm house, a public bathhouse, various shops and a police box. The museum is a branch of the superb [Edo-Tokyo Museum](e3070.html) in Tokyo's [Ryogoku](e3022.html) district.

Streetcar

The open air museum is located in the western part of Koganei Park, Koganei City, 25 minutes west of Tokyo's [Shinjuku](e3011.html) Station by train. From Shinjuku, take either the Seibu Shinjuku Line to Hana-Koganei Station (290 yen) or [JR Chuo Line](e2372.html) to Musashi-Koganei Station (320 yen). From either station, the park is a 5-10 minute [bus](e2015.html) ride or 15-30 minute walk.
