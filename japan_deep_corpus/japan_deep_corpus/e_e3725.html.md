The Shimokita Peninsula (下北半島, Shimokita Hantō) is the axe-shaped peninsula located at the northernmost tip of Japan's main island Honshu. The remote peninsula's main attraction is [Osorezan](e3727.html) ("Fear Mountain"), whose barren, steaming and sulfur-rich landscape resembles descriptions of [Buddhist](e2055.html) hell.

The peninsula is generally known for its rugged scenery, wild landscape and harsh weather. While these aspects are part of the region's attraction, they also result in widespread closures during the winter months.
