The Shodoshima Great Kannon (小豆島大観音, Shōdoshima Daikannon) is a large white statue depicting Kannon, the [Buddhist](e2055.html) goddess of mercy. Completed in 1993 on the mountainside overlooking western [Shodoshima Island](e5430.html), the 50 meter tall statue houses a [temple](e2058.html) inside.

Visitors may enter and climb (or take an elevator most of the way) to the top floor built into the Kannon's chest where the temple's holy relic, a tooth of the historical [Buddha](e2055.html) donated by a temple in Sri Lanka, is enshrined. This floor doubles as an observation deck with nice views.

Inside the base of the statue is a maze-like series of halls containing hundreds of golden miniature replicas of the Great Kannon, which have been donated by temple goers. There is also a large traditional altar in the central hall where visitors may worship.

### By bus

From Tonosho or Ikeda port, take a [bus](e2015.html) along the Kitamawari Fukuda Line (北廻り福田線) bound for Fukuda Port (福田港) and get off at Shodoshima Daikannon-mae (小豆島大観音前). The one way ride takes 30 minutes and costs 500 yen. There are direct connections every 2-3 hours from either port. The statue is a ten minute walk uphill from the bus stop.

### By car or taxi

Alternatively the statue is accessible by [rental car](e2024.html) or [taxi](e2021.html) in about 15 minutes from Tonosho Port (about 3000 yen one way by taxi).
