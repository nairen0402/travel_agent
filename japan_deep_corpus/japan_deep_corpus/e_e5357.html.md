Hakodate Port was among the first Japanese ports to be opened to international trade towards the end of the [feudal era](e2128.html). Several red brick warehouses from past trading days survive along the waterfront in the bay area of [Hakodate](e5350.html) and have been redeveloped into an atmospheric shopping, dining and entertainment complex.

Besides a typical range of trendy souvenir, fashion, interior and sweets shops, the complex also features a restaurant, a beer hall, a chapel for weddings and sightseeing cruises of the bay.

The red brick warehouses are a 15-20 minute walk from Hakodate Station or a five minute walk from the Jujigai tram stop (5 minutes, 210 yen from Hakodate Station).
