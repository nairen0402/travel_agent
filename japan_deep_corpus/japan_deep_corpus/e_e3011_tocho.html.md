The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building (東京都庁, Tōkyō Tochō) in [Shinjuku](e3011.html) is often visited by tourists for its free [**observation decks**](e3057.html) which provide good panoramic views of [Tokyo](e2164.html) and beyond. The 243 meter tall building has two towers, and each houses an observatory at a height of 202 meters. It had been the tallest building in Tokyo until it was overtaken by the [Midtown Tower](e3031_midtown.html) in 2007.

With favorable [weather](e2273.html) conditions, famous landmarks such as [Mount Fuji](e2172.html), the [Tokyo Skytree](e3064.html), [Tokyo Tower](e3009.html), [Meiji Shrine](e3002.html) and the [Tokyo Dome](e3039.html) can be seen from the observatories. Each observatory has a cafe and a souvenir shop.

Visitors taking pictures

The towers and the surrounding buildings contain offices and the assembly hall of the metropolitan government of [Tokyo](e2164.html). Visitors are therefore subjected to bag checks prior to boarding the elevators as part of the security measures.

On the second story of the building, there is a tourist information center with lots of information about Tokyo, but also about various other [tourist destinations across Japan](e623a.html). Periodically, the center holds fairs during which local products from selected regions are introduced and put on sale.

Huge daily **projection mapping shows** of around 15 minutes are held on the twin towers every 30 minutes in the evenings, except during bad weather. They can be viewed for free from many locations around the building. [Times vary with the seasons](#section_admission).

View from the southern observatory

Tocho-mae Station on the Oedo Subway Line is located in the basement of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building. Alternatively, the building can be reached in a ten minute walk from the west exit of JR Shinjuku Station.
