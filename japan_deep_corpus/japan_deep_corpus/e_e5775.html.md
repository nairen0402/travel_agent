Takahashi (高梁), often referred to as Bitchu-Takahashi after the surrounding region to distinguish it from other places with the same name, is a small city in the mountainous interior of [Okayama Prefecture](/list/e1232.html). Takahashi is best known for [Matsuyama Castle](e5777.html), which sits high up on the mountain above town and is the only original mountaintop [castle](e2296.html) and one of the oldest surviving castle in Japan.

At the base of the mountain lies Takahashi's preserved [old town](e5778.html), which is home to samurai residences and merchant houses that date back to the [feudal ages](e2128.html). A few museums and [temples](e2058.html) are also scattered about Takahashi, including [Raikyuji Temple](e5779.html) whose Zen [garden](e2099.html) was designed by the local lord and famous garden designer Kobori Enshu.
