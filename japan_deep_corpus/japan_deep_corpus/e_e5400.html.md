Takamatsu (高松) is the capital of [Kagawa](/list/e1233.html), Japan's smallest prefecture. The city's [port](e5406.html) used to be the main entry point to Shikoku Island until the opening of the Seto Ohashi Bridge in 1988.

The Matsudaira Clan, relatives of the [Tokugawa Shogun](e2128.html), controlled Takamatsu's former [castle town](e2296.html) and surrounding area, then known as the Sanuki Province, during most of the [Edo Period](e2128.html). The ruling clan is also responsible for the construction of [Ritsurin Koen](e5401.html), one of Japan's most beautiful [gardens](e2099.html).
