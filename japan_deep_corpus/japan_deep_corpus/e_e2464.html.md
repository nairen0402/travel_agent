Japan is home to more species than most other countries in the world thanks to the archipelago's large north-south extension from subarctic to subtropical latitudes and the abundance of marine life along her coast. Japan's islands are inhabited by land animals such as bears, foxes, monkeys, deer, wild boars and birds. Furthermore, there are numerous [aquariums](e2425.html) and zoos of varying quality across the country.
