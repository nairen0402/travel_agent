Ikaho Onsen (伊香保温泉) is a [hot spring](e2292.html) town located on the eastern slopes of [Mount Haruna](e7480.html). Known for its reddish brown, iron-laden thermal waters, Ikaho Onsen joins [Kusatsu](e7400.html), [Minakami](e7460.html) and [Shima Onsen](e7435.html) as the four most famous [hot spring](e2292.html) resorts of [Gunma Prefecture](/list/e1209.html).

The atmospheric old town area of Ikaho centers around the 300 meter long [stone stairs](e7478.html) which lead up through the middle of town and are lined by [ryokan](e2029.html), old fashioned game arcades and shops. It retains a certain feel of the [Showa Period](e2129.html) (1926-1989).

A few kilometers outside of Ikaho stands [Mizusawa Kannon](e7479.html), a popular [temple](e2058.html), well known for the [udon](/r/e105.html) noodles sold at restaurants along its approach. [Mount Haruna](e7480.html) with its beautiful caldera lake can also be easily combined with a visit to Ikaho.
