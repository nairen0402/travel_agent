The Hara Museum ARC is a [contemporary art](e2115.html) museum found next to the [Green Bokujo](e7482.html) near [Ikaho Onsen](e7475.html). Its location in the spacious countryside allows for a number of permanent pieces to be placed outside around the museum grounds. One such example is a giant version of Andy Warhol's iconic Campbell's Soup can, which stands curiously amongst the trees.

The museum displays a rotating exhibition of contemporary art by both Japanese and foreign artists. In addition to its main indoor exhibition space, the museum also has a separate building, the Kankei Pavilion, where it displays a collection of traditional East Asian art. The Hara Museum ARC used to be the annex of the Hara Museum of Contemporary Art, which stood in [Tokyo](e2164.html)'s [Shinagawa](e3040.html) district until its closure in 2021.
