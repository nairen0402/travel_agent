Himeji (姫路) is most famous for its magnificent castle, [Himeji Castle](e3501.html), widely considered to be Japan's best and most beautiful surviving feudal [castle](e2296.html). The castle is designated both a national treasure and a [UNESCO world heritage site](e2251.html).

With half a million inhabitants, Himeji is the second largest city of [Hyogo Prefecture](/list/e1230.html) after [Kobe](e2159.html). It can be reached in less than one hour from [Osaka](e2157.html) or [Kyoto](e2158.html) and is also a popular stopover on journeys along the [Sanyo Shinkansen](e2018_sanyo.html), for example, on a trip from Tokyo or Kyoto to [Hiroshima](e2160.html).
