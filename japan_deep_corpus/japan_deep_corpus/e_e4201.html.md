The Seisonkaku Villa (成巽閣, Seisonkaku) was built in the last years of the [Edo Period](e2128.html) by a Maeda lord for his mother. It is one of the most elegant, remaining [samurai](e2127.html) villas in Japan.

Located in the southeast corner of [Kenrokuen](e4200.html), Seisonkaku is a large structure with a number of expansive [tatami](e2007.html) rooms on two floors. One of its interesting features is the roof which covers its garden viewing deck. It was built without supports that would interrupt the view of the garden.

The villa has a direct entrance to [Kenrokuen](e4200.html) (separate admission fees apply). Signs and information are provided in both Japanese and English.

Seisonkaku Villa is located directly adjacent to [Kenrokuen](e4200.html) on the opposite side of the garden's main entrance.
