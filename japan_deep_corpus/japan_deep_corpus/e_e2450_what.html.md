There are many different types of shops and shopping areas in Japan. The following are some of the most common types that travelers will encounter:

* 

  [Department stores](e2072.html)

  Found in all major Japanese cities, [department stores](e2072.html) are known for carrying higher quality products and pride themselves on providing their customers with a high level of service. Accordingly their prices tend to be more expensive. The food section in the basement of department stores are a sight worth calling a tourist attraction, while the stores' restaurant floors are convenient place for tourists to select from a variety of moderately priced dining options.
* 

  Electronics stores

  Electronics chains such as Yodobashi Camera, Bic Camera and Yamada Denki, carry all manner of electronics such as computers, cameras, cell phones, stereos, home appliances, toys, movies, games, gadget and accessories. Many of the chains operate mega stores around major train stations. Some areas known for their electronic stores include [Tokyo](e2164.html)'s [Akihabara](e3003.html), [Shinjuku](e3011.html) and [Ikebukuro](e3038.html) districts, as well as [Osaka](e2157.html)'s [Den Den Town](e4001.html).
* 

  [100 yen shops](e2077.html)

  [100 yen shops](e2077.html) sell a wide range of products for just 100 yen per item (plus [consumption tax](e2206.html)), making then a great place to shop for travelers and residents on a budget. There are several 100 yen store chains with branches all across Japan.
* 

  [Convenience stores](e2071.html)

  Over 40,000 [convenience stores](e2071.html), known as konbini, can be found across Japan. Open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, convenience stores offer food, beverages, essential household goods and a wide range of services, such as [ATM](e2208.html)s, [shipping](e2278.html) and ticket services, which make Japanese convenience stores truly convenient.
* 

  Shopping malls

  Shopping malls are found both in the large cities and in the countryside. Malls tend to be dominated by clothing stores and usually include restaurant floors or food courts, movies theaters and videogame arcades.
* 

  Underground malls

  Underground malls are commonly found around and below major railway stations in large cities where space is a premium. In some cases, multiple underground malls are interconnected, creating huge underground networks. Not surprisingly, [Tokyo](e2164.html) and [Osaka](e2157.html) have some of the most extensive underground malls.
* 

  Temple and shrine approaches

  The approaches to popular [temples](e2058.html) and [shrines](e2059.html) are traditionally lined by shops and restaurants catering to the passing pilgrims and tourists. Some particularly lively ones are the Nakamise at [Tokyo](e2164.html)'s [Sensoji Temple](e3001.html) and the approach to [Kyoto](e2158.html)'s [Kiyomizudera Temple](e3901.html).
* 

  [Public markets](e2452.html)

  [Public markets](e2452.html) are packed with vendors and restaurants selling all manner of fresh fish, [vegetables](e2346.html), meat and prepared foods. Often serving both restaurants and the public, they tend to open and close earlier than other shopping districts, but are a fun way to explore the culinary side of Japan. Famous markets include [Tokyo](e2164.html)'s [Tsukiji Outer Market](e3021.html), [Kyoto](e2158.html)'s [Nishiki Market](e3931.html), [Kanazawa](e2167.html)'s [Omicho Market](e4207.html) and [Hakodate](e5350.html)'s [Morning Market](e5353.html).
* 

  [Supermarkets](e2073.html)

  [Supermarkets](e2073.html) in Japan are organized in much the same way as in other parts of the world. They are most numerous in the suburbs and in medium sized cities and towns; however, they are more difficult to find in the centers of Japan's largest cities.
* 

  Flea markets

  If flea markets are your thing, then Japan has some excellent ones that are worth checking out. Here you will find all types of new and used art, crafts, clothing, traditional goods, antiques, food, jewelry, tools and weapons. Some of the most famous are held at Kyoto's [Toji Temple](e3919.html) and [Kitano Tenmangu Shrine](e3939.html).
* 

  [Outlet malls](e2451.html)

  Typically found in the outskirts of large cities, near [airports](e2365.html) and along [expressways](e2354.html), [outlet malls](e2451.html) are popular with those looking for a deal on brand name goods. While the prices may be better than at regular retail shops, be aware that the bargains and discounts may not be as deep as you might expect at an outlet shop. Regardless, outlet malls are a fun activity for those who enjoy shopping. One of the largest and most popular outlet malls is the [Gotemba Premium Outlets](e5213.html).
