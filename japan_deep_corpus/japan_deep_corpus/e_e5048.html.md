The Sant Juan Bautista Museum (サン・ファン館, San Fuan Kan) outside central [Ishinomaki](e5040.html) is devoted to and named after the Japan-built, Spanish-style galleon that was constructed here in [1600s](e2128.html). The original ship was commissioned by Date Masamune, the feudal lord based in nearby [Sendai](e5150.html), and embarked on two trans-Pacific journeys carrying diplomatic missions across to the ocean to Mexico on their way to the Vatican. These were to be some of the last diplomatic missions to depart before Japan entered its 200 year long period of isolation.

The museum offers excellent displays and an interesting motion simulator video that explain the history of the ship, details of its construction, and how its creation and diplomatic mission fit into the greater framework of Japan during the Age of Exploration. A replica of the Sant Juan Bautista at a scale of 1/4 is on display.
