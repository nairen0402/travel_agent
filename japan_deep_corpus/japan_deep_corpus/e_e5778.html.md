Takahashi developed at the base of [Matsuyama Castle](e5777.html) into a thriving castle town of [samurai](e2127.html), merchants and craftsmen. Some of the historic streets close to the castle have been preserved, and a few samurai and merchant houses have been restored and opened to the public. There are also temples and a few museums around town.

Note that a convenient, discounted combination ticket is available that provides tourists with admission to the [castle](e5777.html), [Raikyuji Temple](e5779.html) and the two samurai residences for 1000 yen. For 1500 yen, a ticket is available that additionally covers the Takahashi Historical Museum and the Yamada Hokoku Museum.
