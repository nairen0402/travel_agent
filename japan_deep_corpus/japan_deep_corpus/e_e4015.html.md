The Osaka Science Museum (大阪市立科学館, Ōsaka Shiritsu Kagakukan) on Nakanoshima Island has four floors of interactive exhibits. The museum was designed with [children](e2460.html) in mind and takes visitors through displays on the universe, chemistry, electricity and energy.

A science show is held multiple times a day (in [Japanese](e621.html) only). In addition to the exhibits, the Osaka Science Museum has a planetarium with hourly shows. A separate admission fee applies to the planetarium.

The Osaka Science Museum is located on Nakanoshima Island directly adjacent to the [National Museum of Art Osaka](e4016.html). Take the Yotsubashi Subway Line to Higobashi Station, from where the museum can be reached in a 5-10 minute walk. Nakanoshima Station on the Keihan Nakanoshima Line is even closer.
