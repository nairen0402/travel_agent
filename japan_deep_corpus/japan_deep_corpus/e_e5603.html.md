Covered by: [Japan Rail Pass](/e/e2361.html)

Take the [JR Tokaido/Sanyo Shinkansen](e2018.html) from [Tokyo](e2164.html) to [Okayama](e5700.html) (3.5 hours) and transfer to a JR Nanpu [limited express](e2016.html) train for [Kochi](e5600.html) (2.5 hours). The entire one way trip takes around six hours and costs about 21,000 yen. The [Japan Rail Pass](e2361.html) fully covers the entire trip if Hikari and Sakura trains are used along the Tokaido/Sanyo Shinkansen, but a supplement fee is required on the faster Nozomi and Mizuho trains.

Several overnight [highway buses](e2366.html) operate between [Tokyo](e2164.html) and [Kochi](e5600.html). The one way trip takes about 12 hours and costs between 8,900 and 14,500 yen depending on the day of travel. Further discounts can be available for reserving in advance. Online reservations for some of the buses can be made through [Willer](https://willerexpress.com/en/bus_search/tokyo/all/kochi/all/?utm_source=web&utm_medium=ad&utm_campaign=af01&aid=184).

Above fees and schedules are subject to change. Be sure to check current yen [exchange rates](e2196.html).

Even though [Kochi](e5600.html) is a small city, its sights are spread over a wide area. Kochi Station lies at the north end of town. While [Kochi Castle](e5601.html) and the downtown area around [Harimayabashi](e5605.html) are within walking distance of the station, [Mount Godaisan](e5604.html) (4 kilometers southeast of Kochi Station) and [Katsurahama Beach](e5602.html) (8 kilometers south of Kochi Station) are farther away.

Kochi is served by **two tram lines**, operated by Tosaden, the local railway company. One line runs north-south (Sanbashi Line) and the other runs east-west (Ino Line). They meet each other at Harimayabashi in the city center. The fare is a flat 230 yen per ride in the city center.

Trams are used in a similar way as [local buses](e2015.html): Enter through the rear door and take a ticket, and leave through the front door after depositing the fare into the box next to the driver. Passengers transferring between the two lines need to ask the driver for a transfer ticket ("norikae-ken") when exiting the first tram. [IC cards](e2359_003.html), such as Suica, cannot be used.

Tosaden also operates **buses** that provide access to [Katsurahama Beach](e5602.html). Furthermore, there is the **My Yu Bus**, a bus line for tourists, which connects central Kochi with [Godaisan](e5604.html) and [Katsurahama](e5602.html) roughly hourly. The cost is 900 yen for a day of unlimited rides between Kochi Station and Godaisan, and 1300 yen for a day of unlimited rides between Kochi Station and Katsurahama.

**Kochi Ryoma Airport**, named after local hero Sakamoto Ryoma, is located to the east of the city. It is connected to Kochi Station via an airport bus (40 minutes, 900 yen one way).
