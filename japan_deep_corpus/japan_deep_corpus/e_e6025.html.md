Yamanouchi (山ノ内) is a municipality in northern [Nagano Prefecture](/list/e1216.html) with a variety of tourist attractions. The area's [Jigokudani Monkey Park](e6028.html) draws many visitors because of its unique, wild monkeys who bathe in the park's [natural hot springs](e2292.html). The monkeys are not the only ones enjoying the water, as the nearby towns of [Shibu Onsen](e6029.html) and [Yudanaka Onsen](e6024.html) are centered around the bathing experience.

The largest [ski resort](e2262.html) in Japan, [Shiga Kogen](e6026.html), is also located within Yamanouchi. One single ticket gives skiers and snowboarders access to dozens of runs, some of which hosted events during the [1998 Nagano Winter Olympics](e6002.html). Shiga Kogen and other parts of Yamanouchi are part of the Joshinetsu Kogen National Park, which offers hiking and other outdoor activities when there is no snow on the hills.
