Kakegawa (掛川) is a small city known primarily as a center of [tea](e6343.html) production within [Shizuoka Prefecture](/list/e1218.html); which itself is the number one producer of [tea](e2041.html) in Japan. Located on the [Tokaido Shinkansen](e2018_tokaido.html), less than two hours from [Tokyo](e2164.html), the town makes for a convenient side trip for those traveling to and from the capital.

Kakegawa's most prominent features include its abundant [tea fields](e6343.html), which span acres of rolling hillside in the outskirts of the city and where in some places stunning views can be had of the tea fields before [Mount Fuji](e2172.html) in the background. Tea aside, the town is known for its [castle](e6342.html), which notably features a tower built with traditional materials, and one of only a few castle palaces to have survived from the [Edo Period](e2128.html) (1603-1868). The town also boasts a [bird park](e6344.html) which is widely regarded as the best in the country.
