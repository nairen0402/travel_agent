Hitsujiyama Park (羊山公園, Hitsujiyama Kōen) is a park in [Chichibu](e6550.html), known for its beautiful moss pink fields that typically come into bloom around late April to early May and attract droves of visitors.

The Hill of Pink Moss fields are located at the southern end of the park and have multiple types of moss pink (or shibazakura) spread over the undulating fields to give them hues of pink, purple and white. The [flowers](e2423.html) have been planted strategically to make colorful patterns that make for quite the display.

The park attracts many visitors, especially when the flowers are in bloom

Hitsujiyama Park is accessed in a 15-20 minute walk from Seibu-Chichibu Station.
