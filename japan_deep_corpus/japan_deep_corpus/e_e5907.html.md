Two morning markets (朝市, Asaichi) are held in [Takayama](e5900.html) on a daily basis from around 6:00 (one hour later in winter) to noon: the Miyagawa Market along the Miyagawa River in the [old town](e5903.html), and the Jinya-mae Market in front of the [Takayama Jinya](e5902.html).

The stands sell local crafts, snacks and farm products such as [vegetables](e2346.html), [pickles](e2349.html) and [flowers](e2423.html). There is typically a pleasant atmosphere around the [markets](e2452.html), as tourists and locals alike saunter from stall to stall purchasing goods and food and talking.

Either morning market can be reached in about a ten minute walk from JR Takayama Station.
