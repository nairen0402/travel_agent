Godaido (五大堂, Godaidō) is a small [temple](e2058.html) hall on an islet just next to the pier. Due to its prominent location, it has become a symbol of [Matsushima](e5100.html). Godaido was built in 807 and contains five statues which were enshrined by the same priest who also founded nearby [Zuiganji Temple](e5102.html). The statues are displayed to the public only once every 33 years - the next time is scheduled for 2039.

The present building is a 1604 reconstruction by the local feudal lord Date Masamune. The hall's exterior is decorated by small carvings of the twelve animals of the [lunar calendar](e2272.html), three on each side. Despite its exposed location, the Godaido did not suffer any major damage in the earthquake and tsunami of [March 11, 2011](e5027.html).

Visitors come to the hall to pray

Godaido stands just next to the pier of [Matsushima](e5100.html), a ten minute walk from JR Matsushima Kaigan Station.
