Mount Usu (有珠山, Usuzan) is a volcano which has erupted four times in the past 100 years. Its most recent eruption occurred in the year 2000.

The Usuzan Ropeway brings you close to the volcano's summit. The upper station's observation deck offers panoramic views of [Lake Toya](e6725.html) and neighboring [Showa Shinzan](e6728.html). From a second observation deck a short walk away, there are views of the ocean and Mount Usu's largest crater, which was formed in an eruption in 1977.

The ropeway departs from "Kazan-Mura", a small town of souvenir shops at the foot of [Showa Shinzan](e6728.html). From [Toyako Onsen](e6729.html), it can be reached in 10 minutes by [car](e2024.html) or [taxi](e2021.html) (about 2500 yen one way) or in 15 minutes by [bus](e2015.html) from Toyako Onsen (400 yen one way, almost hourly). Some of the buses run all the way between Toya Station and the ropeway station (35 minutes, 700 yen one way).
