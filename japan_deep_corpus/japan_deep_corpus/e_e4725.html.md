Suyanosaka Slope

The city of Kitsuki (杵築) is located on the southern side of the [Kunisaki Peninsula](e4720.html). The city center is sometimes referred to as a "sandwich castle town", because of its interesting topography of having two [samurai](e2127.html) districts on hills north and south respectively, sandwiching a commercial district in the middle. The districts combined measure about 500 meters north-south and 1.5 kilometers east-west, with Kitsuki Castle standing at the eastern end, close to the coast facing the [Seto Inland Sea](e5445.html).

Successful efforts have been made to keep these historic districts free of distractions such as power lines and unsightly signs, thus preserving their authentic atmospheres. The beautiful town features multiple photogenic slopes and [samurai](e2127.html) residences open to the public. Amiable locals look forward to engage with visitors, making it a friendly environment for tourists.
