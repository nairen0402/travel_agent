Hakone Detached Palace (旧箱根離宮, Kyū Hakone Rikyū) used to serve as a summer palace for the [Imperial Family](e2135.html), but was later opened to the public. It is located at the southern shores of [Lake Ashinoko](e5201.html) on the peninsula between Moto-Hakone and Hakone-machi.

Only a relatively small and simple building remains of the former palace complex without any original furnishing. It is surrounded by a beautiful park, known as Onshi Hakone Park, which offers nice walking trails and scenic views of [Lake Ashinoko](e5201.html) and [Mount Fuji](e2172.html), if visibility permits. Visibility tends to be better during the colder seasons of the year than in summer, and in the early morning and late evening hours.
