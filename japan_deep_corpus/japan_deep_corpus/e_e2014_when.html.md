Because of Japan's great north-south extension, [autumn leaves](e2014.html) can be viewed somewhere in the country during as many as three months! The season starts around mid September in the highest mountains of [Hokkaido](/list/e1101.html) and then gradually moves into lower elevations and more southern latitudes until reaching [Tokyo](e2164.html) and [Kyoto](e2158.html) in the second half of November. In some locations colors can be enjoyed into December.

During the first phase of the season, the colors are found mostly in the mountains where entire slopes turn orange, yellow and red, and provide some of the most amazing seasonal sceneries. [Hiking](e2427.html) is the most rewarding way to see the colorful leaves in the mountains, but many spots can also be conveniently reached by [train](e2019.html), [bus](e2015.html) or ropeway.

In the second phase of the autumn leaf season, the colors descend into Japan's [cities](/list/e1003.html), where they can be viewed in parks and gardens. Among the highlights are the autumn colors in the [temples](e2058.html) [gardens](e2099.html) of [Kyoto](e2158.html) where they beautifully complement with the buildings' elegant architecture. Almost surreal is the sight of the trees during evening illuminations, which are held at selected gardens and temples.

Depending on temperatures during the preceding months and weeks, the timing of the autumn leaf season can vary by a few days to one or two weeks from year to year. The map and the list of popular autumn leaf destinations below show the approximate best timing for seeing the leaves in the average year.

Unlike [cherry blossoms](e2011.html), which usually last for only one week, [autumn colors](e2014.html) can be enjoyed typically over a couple of weeks or so and tend to be slightly easier to catch than the blossoms.
