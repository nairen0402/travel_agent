Weeping cherry trees in the samurai district

[Kakunodate](e3601.html) is one of the [Tohoku](/list/e1102.html) region's most famous [cherry blossom](e2011.html) spots. Around one million people visit Kakunodate's cherry blossom festival each year. The blossoms are usually at their best during the [Golden Week](e2282.html) in late April and early May.

It was during the [Edo Period](e2128.html) (1603-1868), that several weeping cherry trees were imported from distant [Kyoto](e2158.html). This was done by local [samurai](e2127.html) families in an attempt to outperform each other in cultivating the most beautiful trees. Their efforts are still visible in the [samurai district](e3602.html), where dozens of weeping cherry trees line the streets.

In addition, several hundreds of [somei yoshino](e2011_species.html) cherry trees were later planted along Hinokinai River, which runs through Kakunodate. The Hinokinai riverbank provides a great location for [hanami](e2011.html) picnics under the blossoms.

Cherry trees along the river

[Kakunodate](e3601.html)'s former samurai district and the cherry tree lined Hinokinai River are a 20 minute walk or a short [taxi](e2021.html) ride from JR Kakunodate Station.
