Kinugawa Onsen is a popular [hot spring](e2292.html) destination near [Nikko](e3800.html) in [Tochigi Prefecture](/list/e1210.html). The clear, mild waters that flow from the area's hot springs have been in use since the [Edo Period](e2128.html) (1603-1868), and can be experienced at Kinugawa Onsen's [ryokan](e2029.html).

Most visitors to Kinugawa Onsen overnight at one of the large hotel [ryokan](e2029.html) overlooking the Kinugawa River. Each of the ryokan has its own baths, some of which are open to non-staying guests during daytime. A few free foot baths (ashiyu) can also be found around Kinugawa Onsen. The town also had a [public bath](e2074.html), but it closed in 2024.

More hot springs are found in Kawaji Onsen farther up the river, as well as in [Yunishigawa Onsen](e3882.html) and [Okukinu Onsen](e3883.html), two rustic hot spring destinations in remote side valleys.
