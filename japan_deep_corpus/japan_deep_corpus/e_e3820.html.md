Lake Chuzenjiko viewed from Chuzenji Temple

Chuzenji Temple (中禅寺, Chūzenji) stands on the eastern bank of [Lake Chuzenjiko](e3806.html), which was named after the [temple](e2058.html). Chuzenji's main object of worship is a six meter tall statue of Kannon, the [Buddhist](e2055.html) Goddess of Mercy. The statue is unique for being carved out of a tree which is still rooted into the ground today.

The second story of the temple complex houses a rare assembly of all five Buddhist Deva Kings (Myo-o). The hall's ceiling sports a giant painting of a white dragon by the same artist who painted the "Crying Dragon" at [Toshogu Shrine](e3801.html). The ceiling of the inner chamber is coffered and decorated with paintings of over a hundred [flower](e2423.html) varieties found around [Nikko](e3800.html). From the veranda, visitors can enjoy beautiful views over [Lake Chuzenjiko](e3806.html).

### On foot

Chuzenji Temple is a 20 minute walk from the [Chuzenji Onsen](e3806.html) bus terminal.

### By bus

Only during October and early November, a [bus](e2015.html) operates between Chuzenji Onsen and [Hangetsuyama](e3815.html) (半月山), stopping at the Tachikikannon-Yuransenhachakujo bus stop (立木観音・遊覧船発着所, 5 minutes, 200 yen one way, every 2 hours) along the way. Chuzenji Temple is located a few steps from that bus stop.
