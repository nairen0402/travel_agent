Business hotels can be found readily across Japan, providing economical and no-frills [accommodation](e2025.html) to travelers. The charge is typically between 7,000 and 15,000 yen per night for a single room, and many hotels also have a few twin or double rooms for typically 8,000 to 20,000 yen. Although rooms are relatively small, they are usually clean and well kept, and feature an attached bathroom with [toilet](e2003.html), sink and a small tub.

Basic amenities such as soap, shampoo, toothbrush and toothpaste, razors, cotton buds, shower caps and towels are normally provided. Most rooms also come with a television, an air conditioner, a [telephone](e2223.html), a hairdryer, an empty refrigerator and a water boiler with complimentary green [tea](e2041.html) bags.

[Wireless internet access](e2279.html) is commonly available for free in the rooms. Pay-TV is frequently available; typically the guest can purchase a prepaid card at a machine placed along the corridor, and then slot it into a card reader in his room to gain access to the channels.

Unit bathroom

In most business hotels, there is a common room located every two or three floors where [vending machines](e2010.html) and coin-operated washing machines are placed. Coin-operated drying machines are also often available. Should an iron be needed, it is sometimes placed in this room. Otherwise, make the request to the service counter, and if available, it would usually be brought to your room.

Some business hotels adopt a self check-in and check-out system through machines placed in the lobby. Upon checking in, the guest makes payment for the room and receives his room key in the form of a card. Upon checking out, the guest inserts the room key into the machine, which consequently informs the guest should there be any additional charges. Upon making payment (if any), the guest receives a receipt and the checkout process is complete.

Some business hotel chains, such as Route Inn, APA Hotel, Super Hotel, Daiwa Roynet Hotel, Dormy Inn and Toyoko Inn, operate dozens of hotels across Japan, often in convenient locations near [railway](e2019.html) stations or [expressway](e2354.html) exits.
