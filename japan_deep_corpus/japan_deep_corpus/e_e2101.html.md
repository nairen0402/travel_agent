An appropriate style and color of kimono is to be worn depending on the occasion and the person's age and marital status.

Men's kimono usually have more subdued colors and are made typically from matte fabrics. Partly for this reason, it is the women's kimono that generate more interest because their beautiful designs make them art pieces as much as they are garments. The women's kimono is traditionally made of silk, but these days they are also made of polyester. Decoration techniques include embroidery, yuzen painting and dyeing.

Kimono cost from around 10,000 [yen](e2196.html) for a simple set made of cheap fabric to millions of yen for a luxurious silk outfit with intricate embroidery or yuzen designs. The outfit is accompanied by traditional footwear and a small handbag for women. One price level lower are [yukata](e2103.html), a casual version of the kimono popularly worn at [ryokan](e2029.html) and during summer [festivals](e2063.html).
