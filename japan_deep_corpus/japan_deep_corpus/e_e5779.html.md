Raikyuji Temple (頼久寺, Raikyūji) is a temple of the Rinzai school of [Japanese Zen Buddhism](e2055.html) in [Takahashi](e5775.html)'s [old town](e5778.html). The temple once served as the residence of Kobori Enshu, a local feudal lord who was also active as a renowned [architect](e2111.html), [garden](e2099.html) designer and [tea ceremony](e2096.html) master.

Kobori Enshu designed famous [castles](e2296.html), palaces and gardens across Japan, especially in [Kyoto](e2158.html). Some of his most famous projects include the renovation of the [local castle](e5777.html) and the design of [Nagoya Castle](e3300.html), [Sumpu Castle](e6352.html) in [Shizuoka](e6350.html) and numerous gardens across Japan including those at the [Sento Palace](e3935.html), [Nijo Castle](e3918.html), [Kodaiji Temple](e3927.html) and [Daitokuji Temple](e3910.html).

Kobori Enshu also designed the dry garden at Raikyuji Temple. The garden incorporates elements such as islands representing a crane and turtle (symbols of longevity and health) and [borrowed scenery](e2099_elements.html), which he commonly employed in his designs. Visitors can view the garden from the temple building, but it cannot be entered.

Raikyuji Temple is a 10-15 minute walk from Bitchu-Takahashi Station.
