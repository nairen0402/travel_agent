[Overnight buses](e2366.html) operate daily between [Tokyo](e2164.html) (multiple bus terminals) and Tokushima Station, stopping off at the Kosoku Naruto bus stop along the way (7,700 - 13,800 yen one way depending on the date of travel). From there, walk five minutes to the Konarutobashi bus stop from where [local buses](e2015.html) provide connections to Naruto Station (3 minutes, 170 yen, 2-3 buses/hour) and [Naruto Park](e7852.html) (20 minutes, 350 yen, one bus/hour).

Because [buses](e2366.html) are faster and cheaper than trains for travel between [Osaka](e2157.html) and Naruto, it makes sense for train travelers from Tokyo to transfer to a bus in Osaka:

1) [How to travel between Tokyo and Osaka](e4006.html)
  
2) [How to travel between Osaka and Naruto](e7851.html?aFROM=2157_7850)

It is also possible to travel between Tokyo and Naruto entirely by train, but it is slower and more expensive than the above-mentioned route. It may be of interest to [Japan Rail Pass](e2361.html) holders:

From Tokyo Station take the [JR Tokaido/Sanyo Shinkansen](e2018.html) to [Okayama](e5700.html) (3.5 hours) and transfer to the JR Marine Liner to [Takamatsu](e5400.html) (1 hour). Alternatively, take the Sunrise Seto [night train](e2356.html) from Tokyo to Takamatsu (10 hours). Then, from Takamatsu take the "Uzushio" [limited express](e2016.html#category) to Ikenotani Station (1 hour) and change to a local train to Naruto Station (20 minutes). From Naruto Station regular city [buses](e2015.html) serve Naruto Park (20 minutes, 390 yen).

Above fees and schedules are subject to change. Be sure to check current yen [exchange rates](e2196.html).

[Naruto](e7850.html) is a spread out city with all of its main attractions located outside of the city center. Naruto Park and the whirlpools are about six kilometers north of central Naruto, while the [German-related sights](e7855.html) and [Ryozenji Temple](e7854.html) are about ten kilometers west of the city center.

Visitors **arriving by train** will get off at JR Naruto Station, the terminal station in the city center, from where it is a 20 minute [bus](e2015.html) ride north to Naruto Park and the [whirlpools](e7852.html).

For those **arriving by highway bus**, note that the [highway buses](e2366.html) do not serve central Naruto, but instead only stop along the [expressway](e2354.html). The main stop along the expressway is **Naruto Kosoku** bus stop, from where travelers can catch a [local bus](e2015.html) from the nearby Konarutobashi bus stop to reach the city center (Naruto Station) or [Naruto Park](e7852.html).

A second stop along the expressway, **Naruto Koen-guchi** bus stop, is located at Naruto Park, however it is served only by highway buses coming from [Osaka](e2157.html) or [Kyoto](e2158.html), but not in the opposite direction. In the opposite direction, travelers have to board the highway buses at the above-mentioned Naruto Kosoku bus stop.

Tokushima Airport is a 15 minute [bus](e2015.html) ride south of Naruto Station (340 yen one way). Most of the airport buses continue on from Naruto Station to [Naruto Park](e7852.html) (580 yen one way).

Although all of Naruto's attractions can be reached by public transportation, connections are not very frequent and a [rental car](e2024.html) is a convenient alternative. Rental car outlets can be found in Tokushima City and at Tokushima Airport.
