Although probably better known for its traditional culture and technologically advanced cities, Japan is also a country of mountains. More than seventy percent of the [volcanic](e2327.html) archipelago is covered by towering volcanic peaks and snow capped summits; and these mountains, which have traditionally held important religious and cultural significance, provide nothing short of a haven for outdoor sports enthusiasts.

Naturally the country has developed a vibrant hiking culture to go along with its geography. Whether you are seeking long, multi-day treks through the [national parks](e2325.html) or easy daytrips from the city, Japan offers abundant hiking opportunities through a diverse set of climates and difficulty levels. Below is an incomplete list of recommended hiking destinations:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Difficulty | Meaning |
| **Easy** | Casual day hikes that are well traveled and well marked. They are are often easily accessible by public transportation or are at least located close to local accommodation. No special equipment is necessary. May also be appropriate for hiking with younger children. |
| **Medium** | May include sections that are steep, long or both. With ample time, they should be doable by a person of average athletic ability. Hiking boots are recommended but not necessary. These hikes may not be suitable for younger children. |
| **Difficult** | Long and strenuous trails that may require maps and navigational skills to complete. Difficult trails should not be undertaken without proper preparation and equipment, and hiking boots are highly recommended. |
