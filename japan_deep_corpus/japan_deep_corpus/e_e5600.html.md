Kochi (高知, Kōchi) is the capital of [Kochi Prefecture](/list/e1236.html) on the southern coast of [Shikoku](/list/e1107.html). The city is small and friendly, with a casual atmosphere and a dose of southern flair.

Kochi boasts several attractions of interest to travelers. A well preserved, original hilltop [castle](e5601.html) from the feudal period marks Kochi's [downtown](e5605.html). Nearby on another mountain, [Godaisan](e5604.html), pilgrims visit [Chikurinji Temple](e5604.html), one of the 88 temples along the Shikoku Pilgrimage. The city is also the proud home of Sakamoto Ryoma, who played a role in realizing the [Meiji Restoration](e2130.html). The Sakamoto Ryoma Memorial Museum is located at the beautiful [Katsurahama Beach](e5602.html), just south of the [city center](e5605.html).
