The Kids Ninja Village (チビッ子忍者村, Chibiko Ninja Mura) is a small [theme park](e2067.html) with [ninja](e2295.html) related attractions located at Mount Togakushi in [Nagano City](e6000.html), the legendary home of the [Togakure Ninja School](e6006.html). The village is set within a forest, featuring many obstacle courses and jungle gyms for visitors to pretend undergoing ninja training.

Despite its name, the Kids Ninja Village has several attractions which also appeal to some adults, although grown up tourists will generally find the nearby [Togakure Ninpo Museum](e6006.html) of higher interest. Many of the village's popular attractions require a separate fee, including blow dart and throwing star shooting and two ninja mansions with labyrinths, trapdoors and contraptions. In one of the mansions there is also a room which uses optical illusion to trick the mind into seeing the extraordinary.

Navigating an obstacle course

Express [buses](e2015.html) for tourists run every hour between Nagano Station, the Kids Ninja Village and the [Togakushi shrines](e6005.html). To reach the ninja village, get off at the Togakushi-Chusha bus stop (戸隠中社, 55 minutes, 2000 yen one way). Seat reservations should be made in advance [online](https://www.highwaybus.com/gp/inbound/inbPlanList?lineId=256) or at the Alpico Bus ticket office at Nagano Station, although it is possible to board the bus without reservation if there are vacant seats.

A separate bus operates hourly between the ninja village and shrines for 400 yen per ride.
