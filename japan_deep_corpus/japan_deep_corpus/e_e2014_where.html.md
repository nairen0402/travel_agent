[Autumn leaves](e2014.html) can be enjoyed in various ways. Early in the season, the colors are found mostly in the mountains, where entire slopes turn orange, yellow and red, and provide some of the most amazing seasonal sceneries. [Hiking](e2427.html) is the most rewarding way to see the colorful leaves in the mountains, but many spots can also be conveniently reached by [train](e2019.html), [bus](e2015.html) or ropeway.

Later in the season, the colors descend into Japan's [cities](/list/e1003.html), where they can be viewed in parks and gardens. Among the highlights are the autumn colors in the [temples](e2058.html) [gardens](e2099.html) of [Kyoto](e2158.html) where they beautifully complement with the buildings' elegant architecture. Almost surreal is the sight of the trees during evening illuminations, which are held at selected spots.

Below is a list of some of the best autumn color spots across Japan:
  
[Hokkaido](#hokkaido) -
[Tohoku](#tohoku) -
[Tokyo](#tokyo) -
[Around Tokyo](#kanto) -
[Central Japan](#central) -
[Kyoto](#kyoto) -
[Western Japan](#west)
