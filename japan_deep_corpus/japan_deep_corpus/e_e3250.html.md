Sandwiched between [Tokyo](e2164.html) and [Yokohama](e2156.html), Kawasaki (川崎) is a large coastal city in [Kanagawa Prefecture](/list/e1215.html) that stretches along the Tamagawa River. Kawasaki's city center lies near the heavily industrialized waterfront; however, the city becomes more and more suburban as you head further inland.

While not a major tourist destination, there are a few attractions found around the city including the [Kawasaki Daishi](e3254.html) temple in the city center, and several museums such as the [Nihon Minkaen](e3253.html) open-air museum and [Fujiko F. Fujio Museum](e3252.html) further out in the suburbs.
