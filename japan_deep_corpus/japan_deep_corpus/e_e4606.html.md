The Reimeikan Museum (黎明館) is dedicated to local history and culture. On three spacious floors it presents a wide variety of exhibits that cover the span of [Kagoshima](/list/e1246.html)'s history from ancient to modern times. There are a few interesting models, such as a large diorama of downtown Kagoshima at the beginning of the [Showa Period](e2129.html) (1926-1989) and a small scale model of a village from the middle ages.

The museum was built on the former site of the local [castle](e2296.html), known as Kagoshima or Tsurumaru Castle, and is surrounded by parts of the former moat and stone walls. The museum and castle ruins are located at the base of [Mount Shiroyama](e4607.html), which literally means "castle mountain" in [Japanese](e621.html).

Within the vicinity of the museum there are a few other museums and cultural attractions. One of the most popular is a statue of the local hero Saigo Takamori, a leader from the [Meiji Restoration](e2130.html) of the late 1860s. Saigo is believed to have died in combat on Shiroyama mountain.

The Reimeikan Museum is a five minute walk from the Shiyakusho-mae tram stop (170 yen per ride). It is also served by the [City View Bus](e4604.html) (35 minutes from Kagoshima Chuo Station), which stops near the statue of Saigo Takamori.
