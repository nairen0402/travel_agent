Hottarakashi Onsen (ほったらかし温泉) is a public [hot spring](e2292.html) bath facility in the mountains north of [Kofu](e6950.html). It offers spectacular panoramic views of the Kofu Plain and the surrounding mountains, including [Mount Fuji](e2172.html) when visibility is good. The bath opens one hour before sunrise and stays open until after dark to allow bathers to experience both dawn and dusk.

The facility offers two separate baths with separate admission fees. The Kocchi no Yu ("Here Bath") usually has shorter hours than the adjacent Acchi no Yu ("Over There Bath") which is positioned further east along the mountainside and thus provides the better sunrise vistas. The [water](e2292_water.html) itself has a high alkali content and feels silky on the skin.

Besides the baths, the Hottarakashi Onsen complex has some sheltered seating areas and vending machines

Hottarakashi Onsen is located on a mountain side northeast of [Kofu](e6950.html). The bath lacks access by public transportation, but can be reached from central Kofu in, about 30 minutes by [car](e2024.html). Alternatively, it is about a ten minute [taxi](e2021.html) ride (around 2500 yen one way) from the nearest [train](e2016.html) station, Yamanashishi Station on the JR Chuo Main Line (15 minutes, 240 yen from Kofu).
