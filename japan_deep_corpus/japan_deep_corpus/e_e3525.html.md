Kinosaki Onsen (城崎温泉) is located in northern [Hyogo Prefecture](/list/e1230.html) on the coast of the Sea of Japan. This pleasant town, built along a willow-lined river, is one of the top [onsen](e2292.html) destinations of the [Kansai Region](/list/e1105.html).

Hot springs were discovered in Kinosaki around the 8th century and since then the town has developed into a charmingly old-fashioned [onsen town](e3527.html). In the evenings guests of the local [ryokan](e2029.html) stroll about town in [yukata](e2103.html) and geta (wooden clogs), visiting the numerous [public baths](e3527.html) and nostalgic [game arcades](e3528.html).
