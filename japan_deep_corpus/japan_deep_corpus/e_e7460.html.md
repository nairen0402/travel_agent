Minakami (水上) is a mountainous [hot spring](e2292.html) resort town within easy reach of [Tokyo](e2164.html) in northern [Gunma Prefecture](/list/e1209.html). In the shadow of nearby [Mount Tanigawa](e7462.html), Minakami, together with [Kusatsu](e7400.html), [Ikaho](e7475.html) and [Shima](e7435.html), make up the four best known hot spring towns of Gunma. Perhaps its most famous baths are found at [Takaragawa Onsen](e7463.html#takaragawa), a mixed hot spring with some of the largest outdoor baths in Japan.
