### Seat reservations

Seat reservations can be made at no additional cost at ticket offices. The first six reservations can alternatively be made at ticket machines, but subsequent reservations can be made only at ticket offices. Furthermore, those who purchased their pass through the [official JR West website](https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/) can also use the JR West website to make seat reservations, but the website is not very easy to use.

### Assessment

The JR Hiroshima Yamaguchi Area Pass can be a good value for travelers who visit [Hiroshima](/list/e1238.html) and/or [Yamaguchi](/list/e1239.html) Prefectures by the [Sanyo Shinkansen](e2018_sanyo.html). It is, for example, already cheaper than regular tickets for a shinkansen round trip between [Hiroshima](e2160.html) and [Fukuoka](e2161.html).
