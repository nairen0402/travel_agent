### Assessment

The Mt. Fuji Shizuoka Area Tourist Pass Mini is slightly awkward to use because it does not provide access to/from any airport or major city. Instead its coverage area ends just outside [Tokyo](e2164.html) and [Nagoya](e2155.html). Nevertheless, the pass can pay off for those visiting [Mount Fuji](e2172.html) together with other sites in [Shizuoka Prefecture](/list/e1218.html), such as the [Izu Peninsula](e6310.html) or [Shizuoka City](e6350.html).
