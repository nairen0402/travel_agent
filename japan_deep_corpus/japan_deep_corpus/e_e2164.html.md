Tokyo (東京, Tōkyō) is Japan's capital and the world's most populous metropolis. It is also one of Japan's 47 [prefectures](/list/e1002.html), consisting of 23 central city wards and multiple cities, towns and villages west of the city center. The [Izu](e8252.html) and [Ogasawara Islands](e8200.html) are also part of Tokyo.

Prior to 1868, Tokyo was known as Edo. Previously a small [castle town](e2296.html), Edo became Japan's political center in 1603 when [Tokugawa Ieyasu](e2128.html) established his feudal government there. A few decades later, Edo had grown into one of the world's largest cities. With the [Meiji Restoration](e2130.html) of 1868, the [emperor](e2135.html) and capital moved from [Kyoto](e2158.html) to Edo, which was renamed Tokyo ("Eastern Capital"). Large parts of Tokyo were destroyed in the [Great Kanto Earthquake](/a/earthquake/) of 1923 and the air raids of 1945.

Today, Tokyo offers a seemingly unlimited choice of [shopping](e3053.html), entertainment, culture and [dining](e3075.html) to its visitors. The city's history can be appreciated in districts such as [Asakusa](e3004.html) and in many excellent [museums](e3054.html), historic temples and [gardens](e3034.html). Contrary to common perception, Tokyo also offers a number of attractive [green spaces](e3034.html) in the city center and within relatively short train rides at its outskirts.
