Below is a list of [Takayama](e5900.html)'s most popular spots for cherry blossom viewing ([hanami](e2011.html)), including the typical timing for best viewing in the average year and japan-guide.com ratings. See also our nationwide list of [famous cherry blossom spots](e2011_where.html).

* 

  Nakabashi Bridge

  Mid to late April

  Approximately 10 minutes on foot from Takayama Station.

  The iconic Nakabashi Bridge is perhaps the most recognizable landmark of [Takayama](e5900.html). It is widely featured on pictures on the [Takayama Festival](e5909.html), as festival floats are carried over it. During spring, the area around the bridge looks particularly photogenic with [cherry blossoms](e2011.html) in bloom.
* 

  Miyagawa Ryokuchi Park

  Mid to late April

  About a 15 minute walk north of Takayama's old town.

  Miyagawa Ryokuchi Park is a simple park along Miyagawa River north of the town center. There are about a hundred trees surrounding a big lawn, which provides some good space for [hanami](e2011_how.html) parties.
* 

  Enakogawa River

  Mid to late April

  15-20 minutes on foot from Takayama Station.

  Enakogawa is a narrow river that flows across the northern section of the [old town](e5903.html). Cherry trees of several varieties are planted along the river flanked on both sides by old-fashioned houses, which provide the setting for a nice leisurely walk.
