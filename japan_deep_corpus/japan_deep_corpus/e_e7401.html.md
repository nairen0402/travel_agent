The Yubatake (湯畑, lit. "hot water field") is the symbol of [Kusatsu](e7400.html) and one of the resort's main sources of [hot spring](e2292.html) water. In fact, with an output of 5000 liters per minute, the Yubatake ranks among Japan's single most productive hot spring sources.

After bubbling to the surface at a temperature of more than 70 degrees Celsius and with a pleasant sulfur odor, the hot spring water is cooled down in the Yubatake's wooden conduits by a few degrees before it gets distributed to the various [ryokan](e2029.html) and [public baths](e2074.html). In addition, sulfuric sediment (yunohana, lit. "hot water flowers") that collects in the wooden conduits over time is periodically harvested and sold as a type of "bath salt" at local shops.

Many [ryokan](e2029.html) and shops are clustered around the Yubatake and there is a steady stream of visitors, many of whom wear [yukata](e2103.html) and geta (traditional sandals) in the evening when the Yubatake is lit up. There is also a foot bath (ashiyu), that can be used for free.

The Yubatake is located in the town center, a five minute walk from the bus terminal.
