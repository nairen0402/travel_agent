The Grand Maze Palladium (巨大迷路パラディアム, Kyodai Meiro Palladium) is a large maze located just across the way from [Nikko Edomura](e3879.html).

To complete this challenging labyrinth you must stamp a card at each of the four towers, one at each corner of the maze, and then find the exit. It takes about 40 minutes to complete on average, and cold drinks are awarded to those that finish in less than 20 minutes. There are no bathrooms or vending machines once inside the maze.

Your ticket is timestamped when you start and finish
