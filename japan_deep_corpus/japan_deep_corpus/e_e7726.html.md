[Buses](e2015.html) provide transportation within Fukushima City; however the attractions outside of the city center, such as [Takayu Onsen](e7729.html) and the [Azuma Mountains](e7754.html), are not well served by public transportation and are better accessed by [rental car](e2024.html). Rental car outlets can be found around Fukushima Station. Note that the [Bandai-Azuma Skyline](e7754.html), a former toll road, is now free to use.
