The Zakimi Castle Ruins (座喜味城跡, Zakimijō-ato) are located on a hill in central [Okinawa Honto](e7101.html), not far from Cape Zampa. Only the stone walls remain, which visitors can ascend for good views over the ruins and the surrounding area and as far as [Shuri Castle](e7103.html) and Naha Port in the distance. The castle is included as one of the [UNESCO World Heritage](e2251.html) designated [Castles of the Ryukyu Kingdom](e7125.html).

Zakimi Castle was built in the early 1400s by the Chuzan Kingdom which ruled over central Okinawa Honto. The castle served as a safeguard against rebels in the north, after the Chuzan Kingdom defeated the Hokuzan Kingdom in the north and eventually united the island into the Ryukyu Kingdom.

The adjacent **Yuntanza Museum** has displays on local folkcraft and history. The museum does not focus on the castle in particular, but gives a general perspective on the local community, including exhibits on archaeological relics, dwellings, funerary customs and the [war](e7105.html).
