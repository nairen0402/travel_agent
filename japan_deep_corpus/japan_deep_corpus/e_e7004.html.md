Genkyuen Garden (玄宮園, Genkyūen) is a [landscape garden](e2099.html) with a central pond and a circular walking trail. Designed after a palace garden from Tang China, it was built on the grounds of [Hikone Castle](e7001.html) in 1677 by the local lord for the entertainment of his guests and family.

There are four small islands scattered across the pond, connected by bridges. [Hikone Castle](e7001.html)'s main keep stands on the hill behind the garden, serving as "borrowed scenery". A cluster of wooden buildings stand next to the pond. In the past they served the entertainment of the lord's guests. Today, they can be used by tourists to enjoy a cup of [tea](e2041.html) (500 yen).

Genkyuen Garden is located at the eastern base of the hill on which the main keep of [Hikone Castle](e7001.html) stands, just outside the inner moat. It can be reached from Hikone Station in a 20-30 minute walk.
