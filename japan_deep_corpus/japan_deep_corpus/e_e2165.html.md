Japan's first permanent capital was established in the year [710](e2132.html) at Heijo, the city now known as Nara (奈良). Prior to that, the capital was moved to a new location whenever a new [emperor](e2135.html) ascended to the throne.

However, as the influence and political ambitions of the city's powerful [Buddhist](e2055.html) monasteries grew to become a serious threat to the government, the capital was moved away from Nara to Nagaoka in 784 and a few years later to [Kyoto](e2158.html).

Nara is located less than one hour from [Kyoto](e2158.html) and [Osaka](e2157.html). Due to its historical importance, the city remains full of cultural treasures, including some of Japan's oldest and largest [temples](e2058.html).
