Kumejima (久米島) is one of the islands that make up the [Okinawa Shoto](e7100.html) island group. It is located about 90 kilometers west of [Okinawa Honto](e7101.html). Like many other of the small islands surrounding Okinawa Honto, Kumejima offers a less developed version of the [beaches](e2461.html) and [Okinawan](/list/e1247.html) culture for which the prefecture is well known. Kumejima is quite small, and traveling from one end of the island to another rarely involves a journey longer than ten kilometers.

Like elsewhere in Okinawa, the [beaches](e2461.html) of Kumejima, [snorkeling](e2424_snorkeling.html) and [diving](e2424_diving.html) are among the principal attractions for visitors. [Hatenohama Beach](e7175.html#hatenohamabeach), an approximately seven kilometer long sand bar surrounded by water just east of the island, is Kumejima's most famous attraction. The beach is highly regarded for its white sand, but can only be accessed by joining a tour. The other beaches of Kumejima are also quite attractive, and are generally less busy than the [beaches found on Okinawa Honto](e7119.html).

Kumejima developed similarly to the rest of the archipelago, where regional rulers appeared and built castles as their seats of power. The [Uegusuku Castle Ruins](e7175.html#uegusukucastleruins) stand on one of the island's highest peaks, affording panoramic views of the surrounding area. However, the castle was not able to resist the forces from [Okinawa Honto](e7101.html), and Kumejima became part of the [Ryukyu Kingdom](e7125.html) in the early 1500s.

Kumejima has two major towns, one is located around the port and is inhabited mostly by locals, while the other is a small town of hotels, restaurants and shops near the [Eef Beach](e7175.html#eefbeach), catering to tourists. A number of small attractions are scattered all throughout the island:

### Beaches and snorkeling

* 

  Hatenohama Beach

  Half day from 3500 yen; full day from 4500 yen

  Multiple companies operate tour boats between Kumejima and Hatenohama Beach. Half day and full day tours are offered. On the sandbar, swimming is restricted to the calmer northern [beach](e2461.html), and the sand is a little rougher than it seems from a distance. The sea has a moderate variety of fish that can be observed by [snorkelers](e2424_snorkeling.html). Washrooms are the only facilities available on the sandbar.
* 

  Ara Beach

  Admission: Free, no parking fees

  Located quite apart from most other attractions, Ara Beach offers visitors an attractive and secluded [beach](e2461.html) atmosphere. The beach is about 500 meters long, and its washroom and changing facilities are not well maintained. Ara Beach offers some good [snorkeling](e2424_snorkeling.html), with a variety of sea life around a group of coral about 200 meters from the shore and a bit difficult to find. Beware of currents.
* 

  Eef Beach

  Admission: Free, no parking fees

  Eef Beach is located beside the main concentration of tourist activity on Kumejima. Nonetheless, it does not get excessively crowded, as it stretches about two kilometers along the coast. The [beach](e2461.html) has both washrooms and changing facilities, and nearby hotels and businesses offer a range of water activities.
* 

  Shinri Beach

  Admission: Free, no parking fees

  Shinri Beach is located in front of the Cypress Resort Hotel on the island's western coast and known for nice sunsets. The [beach](e2461.html) sits in front of a rocky inlet that almost completely drains during low tide.

### Other attractions

* 

  Uegusuku Castle Ruins

  Hours: Always open  
  Admission: Free

  The Uegusuku Castle was the main fortification on Kumejima, located on the island's highest point about 300 meters above sea level. Nowadays only a few small stone walls remain, but the hilltop location still offers panoramic views over the island.
* 

  Pools of Tropical Fish

  Hours: Always open  
  Admission: Free

  On the northern coast of Kumejima exists an interesting spot along the coast where relatively large pools of water with a variety of sea life are separated from the sea during low tide. These pools allow visitors to observe the colorful sea life without even stepping into the water.
* 

  Tatami Ishi Rocks

  Hours: Always open  
  Admission: Free

  The Tatami Ishi are a rock formation on a small island connected to Kumejima by a bridge. They are named after [tatami mats](e2007.html) which they are supposed to resemble. Nearby are a sea turtle museum and a [public bath house](e2074.html).
* 

  Torinokuchi Rock

  Hours: Always open  
  Admission: Free

  The Torinokuchi rock is located at the southern tip of Kumejima and resembles a bird's beak, after which it is named. The rock is accessible by a pleasant walking path that runs along the coast and the "whale viewing hill" with nice views onto the sea.
* 

  Mifuga Rock

  Hours: Always open  
  Admission: Free

  The Mifuga Rock is another unique rock formation along Kumejima's coast. There is a parking lot just beside the rock, and it is possible to walk through the hole in the rock.

### How to get around Kumejima

[Rental cars](e2024.html) are available through a small number of companies at the airport and port and are the most convenient way to travel around the island, while [bicycles](e2210.html) and motorcycles can be rented from some hotels and [minshuku](e2026.html) on the island.

There are three [bus](e2015.html) lines on Kumejima: The Loop Line travels in a circle along the island's main road (4-5 buses per day in either direction), the Airport Line connects the airport with Eef Beach (5-6 round trips per day), and the Shimajiri Line travels from Eef Beach to the southern tip of the island (2-3 round trips per day). Fares depend on the distance traveled and range from 120 yen to 470 yen.
