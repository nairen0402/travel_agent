Tokunoshima (徳之島) is a subtropical island south of [Amami Oshima](e4690.html) that belongs to [Kagoshima Prefecture](/list/e1246.html) and is part of the Satsunan island chain which runs between [Kyushu](/list/e1108.html) and [Okinawa Island](e7101.html). Although less touristically developed, its climate, beaches and vegetation make Tokunoshima similar to the [Okinawan islands](/list/e1247.html). The island has three main town centers: Amagi in the west where the airport is located, Tokunoshima in the east and Isen in the south.

Tourists visit Tokunoshima to experience its relatively uncrowded beaches, several of which are part of Amamigunto National Park. As with Okinawa, the best weather for beach activities is usually from late June to October. In addition to its beaches, the island is known for its style of bullfighting or "bull sumo", and the annual Tokunoshima Triathlon which is held each June.

Like other islands in the region, historically Tokunoshima was part of the Ryukyu Kingdom. In 1624 it was made part of the Satsuma Domain which became present day [Kagoshima Prefecture](/list/e1246.html). For two months in 1862 the legendary [samurai](e2027.html) Saigo Takamori was exiled to Tokunoshima before being transferred to Okinoerabu Island further south. After World War II Tokunoshima was occupied by the United States until its return to Japan in 1953.

### How to get to Tokunoshima

#### By air

JAL operate a few [flights](e2365.html) per day between Tokunoshima Airport and [Kagoshima](e4600.html) from where there are connecting flights to [Tokyo](e2164.html) and other major airports in Japan. The flight between Tokunoshima and Kagoshima take about 70 minutes, and the regular one way fare is around 33,000 yen, however [discount tickets](e2364.html) are usually available for around 19,000 yen.

There are also a few flights per day between Tokunoshima Airport and the neighboring islands of [Amami Oshima](e4690.html) and Okinoerabu. The flight to Amami Oshima take 35 minutes, and the regular one way fare is around 15,000 yen, however [discount tickets](e2364.html) are usually available for around 10,000 yen.

#### By ferry

Tokunoshima has two ports: Kametoku Port on the east coast and Hetono Port on the west coast:

Kametoku Port is used by the daily [ferries](e2355.html) along the route that connects [Kagoshima](e4600.html) with [Amami-Oshima](e4690.html) and [Naha](e7102.html) in [Okinawa](/list/e1247.html). The one way ride from Kagoshima to Tokunoshima takes 15 hours and costs around 12,000 yen, while the one way ride from Naha takes 9.5 hours and costs around 7,000 yen. With a vehicle, the prices increase 5-6 fold depending on the vehicle's size. The ferries are operated by Marix and A Line.

Hetono Port is used by ferries on the Kagoshima-Okinoerabu route which stop at a few additional ports around [Amami Oshima](e4690.html) and does not go all the way to Okinawa. Ferries are operated by A Line and operate roughly once every two or three days.

### How to get around Tokunoshima

Public transportation on Tokunoshima is infrequent. As a result, a [rental car](e2024.html) makes it much easier to get around the island. A small number of car rental outlets are found at the airport and near Kametoku Port.

There are two main [bus](e2015.html) lines on Tokunoshima: the Airport Line connects the airport with Tokunoshima's town center on the east coast once every 1-2 hours, while the other line connects central Tokunoshima's town center via Isen Town along the island's southern coast with Amagi's town center once every 3-4 hours. There are also a few minor bus lines, but they operate even less frequently. Rides cost 120-1230 yen depending on the distance traveled.
