The maps below show the coverage areas of the two passes:

### Validity

1. The passes cover one round trip by Tobu Railway from [Tokyo](e2164.html)'s [Asakusa Station](e3004.html) to [Nikko](e3800.html) and back. They do not cover the direct trains to/from [Shinjuku Station](e3011.html).
2. The round trip is fully covered if done by [express or local](e2016.html#category) trains. However, if using a [limited express](e2016.html#category) train, the limited express fee has to be purchased separately (1450-2140 yen one way) at a Tobu station or [online](https://tobu-japantrip-tickets.com/).
3. In the Nikko area, both passes cover the following buses and trains:
   * Tobu World Heritage sightseeing buses that loop through the town center of Nikko
   * Tobu buses between Nikko Station and Rengeishi bus stop
   * Non-express Tobu trains between Nikko, Shimo-Imaichi and Shin-Fujiwara
4. The Nikko All Area Pass additionally comes with the following benefits:
   * Tobu buses between Nikko Station, [Lake Chuzenjiko](e3806.html) and [Yumoto Onsen](e3807.html)
   * Tobu buses between [Lake Chuzenjiko](e3806.html) and [Hangetsuyama](e3815.html)
   * Tobu buses between Nikko Station, [Kirifuri Waterfall](e3821.html) and Kirifuri Kogen
   * Tobu buses between [Kinugawa Onsen](e3875.html), [Tobu World Square](e3878.html) and [Edo Wonderland](e3879.html)
   * Eco buses between Akanuma and Senjugahama at the western end of [Lake Chuzenjiko](e3806.html) (outside winter)
   * Sightseeing boats on [Lake Chuzenjiko](e3806.html) (outside winter)
   * 4-ride lift ticket at the Nikko Yumoto Ski Resort (winter only)
   * One-time use of the [hot spring](e2292.html) baths at the [Nikko Astraea Hotel](https://www.nikkoastraea.com/en/)
5. Both passes provide discounts at selected tourist facilities, restaurants and shops.
6. The World Heritage Area Pass is valid on up to two consecutive calendar days (midnight to midnight), while the Nikko All Area Pass is valid on up to four consecutive calendar days.
7. The two passes can be used only by people with a non-Japanese passport (and Japanese nationals accompanying them).

### Points of sale

The passes are digital tickets sold through websites such as [Klook](https://www.klook.com/activity/79476-nikko-pass-dynamic-voucher/?aid=12675) and [Japan Experience](https://affiliate.japan-experience.com/click?o=4&a=31&link_id=881). Those with [Japanese](e621.html) reading skills and a Japanese phone number and address can purchase similar passes through [Nikko MaaS](https://www.tobu-maas.jp/lp).

### Assessment

**World Heritage Area Pass** - good for those visiting only the town area

Regular tickets for a round trip between [Asakusa](e3004.html) and [Nikko](e3800.html) cost 2800 yen, which is slightly cheaper than the 3000 yen for the pass. But because the pass also covers unlimited rides on buses in the town center and discounts at selected spots, it can pay off quite easily.

**All Nikko Pass** - lost a lot of its value in April 2025

This pass used to be great value at around 4500 yen until April 2025 when its price was almost doubled to 8000 yen. Many travelers heading beyond the Nikko town center will find it cheaper to combine a World Heritage Area Pass with one of the bus passes available for the [Okunikko](e3818.html) and [Kirifuri Highland](e3821.html) areas (see more details below under "Alternative tickets").

### Alternative tickets

Tobu Bus offers several **bus passes** for unlimited use of [buses](e2015.html) around Nikko which can be purchased at Tobu Nikko Station and JR Nikko Station or through [Jorudan](https://ticket.jorudan.co.jp/tobu-bus-nikko/en/):

* Yumoto Onsen Free Pass (3500 yen): Two days between Nikko and [Yumoto Onsen](e3807.html).
* Chuzenji Onsen Free Pass (2300 yen): Two days between Nikko and [Chuzenji Onsen](e3806.html).
* Kirifuri no taki Free Pass (1500 yen): Two days between Nikko and [Kirifuri Waterfall](e3821.html).
