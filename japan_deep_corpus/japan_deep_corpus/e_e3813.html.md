Ryuzu Waterfall (竜頭ノ滝, Ryūzu no Taki) means "dragon head waterfall" in [Japanese](e621.html). The name comes from the shape of the falls, which resembles the head of a dragon. The waterfall is located on Yukawa River, shortly before the river discharges into [Lake Chuzenji](e3806.html).

Ryuzu Waterfall is flanked by many trees which turn yellow and red during the [autumn leaf season](e2014.html), adding to the fall's fiery, dragon-like appearance. Probably because of its shadowy location, Ryuzu Waterfall is one of the first spots in [Nikko](e3800.html) to see autumn colors. It is usually best in early October.

The waterfall is viewed free of charge from a small observation deck in the back of a rest house that also contains a souvenir shop and a food stand. It is possible to follow the river upstream for about 300 meters along a walking trail and enjoy more views of the impressive river as it rushes towards the lake, before the trail then continues towards the [Senjogahara Marshlands](e3811.html).
