Akechidaira Ropeway

Akechidaira Plateau (明智平) is located near the top of the ascending [Irohazaka Winding Road](e3816.html). At the plateau, there is a parking lot with a free observation area that offers nice views onto the Irohazaka and the valley below. During autumn, this becomes a popular [autumn color spot](e3817.html) as fall colors spread across the landscape.

A rest house stands beside the parking lot, serving as a souvenir shop, cafeteria and the lower station of the **Akechidaira Ropeway**. In three minutes, the ropeway carries visitors to an observation platform further up the mountain for spectacular views over [Kegon Waterfall](e3812.html) and [Lake Chuzenjiko](e3806.html). Outside of winter, it is also possible to reach this upper observation deck in about two hours (one way) via a [hiking](e2427.html) trail from [Lake Chuzenjiko](e3806.html). The trail also connects to [Mount Hangetsuyama](e3815.html).

The Akechidaira Plateau is located along the ascending road of the [Irohazaka Winding Road](e3816.html) and cannot be accessed from the descending road. Two-way traffic between Chuzenji Onsen and the Akechidaira Plateau was abolished in 2019.

From JR or Tobu Nikko station, take a Tobu [bus](e2015.html) bound for [Chuzenji Onsen](e3806.html) or [Yumoto Onsen](e3807.html) and get off at the Akechidaira bus stop (35 minutes, 1250 yen one way, 3-4 buses per hour). Buses in the opposite direction do not stop at Akechidaira.

Akechidaira tends to get very crowded during the [autumn color](e2014.html) season in October and early November with traffic congestion and a lack of parking lots, especially on weekends and [national holidays](e2062.html).
