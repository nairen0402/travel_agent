### How to get to Daisetsuzan National Park

[Daisetsuzan National Park](e6775.html) is a large national park that can be accessed from many different directions. The most popular entrance point is the city of [Asahikawa](e6890.html) northwest of the national park ([how to get to Asahikawa](e6891.html)). Please see the [Asahidake Onsen](e6776.html), [Sounkyo Onsen](e6777.html), [Tenninkyo Onsen](e6778.html), [Ginsendai](e6780.html), [Kogen Onsen](e6781.html) and [Tokachidake Onsen](e6782.html) pages for respective access details.

Above fees and schedules are subject to change. Be sure to check current yen [exchange rates](/e/e2196.html).

A [rental car](e2024.html) is most convenient for exploring [Daisetsuzan National Park](e6775.html) because service by public transportation tends to be infrequent, time-consuming or non-existent. Rental cars are available at Asahikawa Airport and in central [Asahikawa](e6890.html) as well as other airports and major cities across [Hokkaido](/list/e1101.html).
