The [Kansai Region](/list/e1105.html) is home to some of Japan's most popular sightseeing destinations, including [Kyoto](e2158.html), [Osaka](e2157.html), [Nara](e2165.html), [Kobe](e2159.html) and [Himeji](e3500.html). The region is served by a dense rail network which is operated by over half a dozen railway companies. As a result, a myriad of tickets and [rail passes](e2357.html) are available to help tourists save some money. Yet so much selection often leaves our readers confused over which is the best rail pass for them.

### What tickets and passes are available?

Below is a list of passes available for the [Kansai Region](/list/e1105.html) and their pros and cons:

#### IC cards

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Icoca    [click here for details](e2359_003.html)** | |
| Type: | A [prepaid card](e2359_003.html) rather than a rail pass, Icoca can be used on virtually all trains, subways and buses in the Kansai Region (and other metropolitan areas in Japan) instead of cash. The **Kansai One Pass** is a special version of Icoca, exclusively available to foreign tourists, that additionally qualifies for discounts at various attractions in the Kansai Region. Nine IC cards from other regions of Japan, including [Suica and Pasmo](e2359_003.html), can be used instead of Icoca. |
| Pros: | + Provides convenience over payment by cash  + Can be used on JR and non-JR transportation |
| Cons: | - Does not provide any discount on fares over regular tickets |
| Ideal for: | The many travelers whose itineraries do not justify the purchase of a rail pass, especially those who stay for several days in a single city. |

#### City passes

| --- | --- |
| **City passes** | |
| Type: | A variety of day passes for designated transportation in individual cities are available, such as the Osaka Amazing Pass, Osaka One-Day Pass and Kyoto Sightseeing Card. |
| Pros: | + Some day passes can provide savings and convenience over regular tickets. |
| Cons: | - Some day passes are too expensive to pay off for regular travelers  - City passes are not valid outside of the given city |
| Ideal for: | Travelers who extensively use urban transportation in a given city. |

### Which pass is right for me?

#### When visiting only Kyoto or Osaka

If you visit just [Kyoto](e2158.html) or [Osaka](e2157.html), regional passes will not pay off. Using an [IC card](e2359_003.html) in combination with good transportation planning is often most economical. Day passes can also be of good value (see lists of day passes for [Kyoto](e2363.html#ticket) and [Osaka](e4006.html#ticket)), especially the Osaka Amazing Pass. Travelers arriving at [Kansai Airport](e2033.html) should consider the [Haruka 1-Way Ticket](e2361_jrwest.html).

#### When visiting a combination of Osaka, Kyoto, Nara and/or Kobe

These major cities are all within 20-60 minutes of each other and are connected by a variety of inexpensive, local trains. As a result, regional passes do not typically pay off, except possibly the [JR Kansai Mini Pass](e2361_kansai_mini.html). Instead, an [IC card](e2359_003.html) and/or day passes for individual cities are usually the best choice. For transportation to/from the airport, consider the [Haruka 1-Way Ticket](e2361_jrwest.html).

#### When also visiting Himeji

[Himeji](e3500.html) is far enough from the rest of the big cities that a day trip out to see [Himeji Castle](e3501.html) will make some of the regional passes pay off, namely the 1-day [JR Kansai Area Pass](e2361_03.html) and the [Kansai Thru Pass](e2357_005.html).

#### When also visiting Mount Koya

The [Koyasan World Heritage Ticket](e2358_012.html) pays off for a daytrip or overnight visit to [Mount Koya](e4900.html). Alternatively, consider the [Kansai Thru Pass](e2357_005.html), especially if staying at the mountain for more than one night or if also visiting other parts of the Kansai Region besides Mount Koya.

#### When also visiting Kinosaki, Amanohashidate or the Kumano Region

The [JR Kansai Wide Area Pass](e2361_08.html) pays off if you take a side trip to one or more of the more outlying destinations covered by the pass, namely [Kinosaki Onsen](e3525.html), [Amanohashidate](e3990.html) or the [Kumano Region](e4950.html).

#### When also visiting the Ise Shrines

The [Kintetsu Rail Pass](e2357_006.html) can be a good value for those who take a side trip to the [Ise Shines](e4300.html) from any major city in the Kansai Region.

#### For Japan Rail Pass holders

The [Japan Rail Pass](e2361.html) pays off only for long-distance train travel and is not worth purchasing for travel around the Kansai Region alone. Pass holders visiting the Kansai Region will be able to travel between most of the region's cities (one exception is [Mount Koya](e4900.html)); however, the pass does not cover non-JR transportation which is often most convenient for getting around the cities, such as subways and buses in [Osaka](e2157.html) and [Kyoto](e2158.html). Pass holders could consider using an [IC card](e2359_003.html) for the non-JR transportation or day passes for Kyoto or Osaka.
