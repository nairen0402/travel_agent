The Kawaguchiko Music Forest (河口湖オルゴールの森, Kawaguchiko Orgel no Mori) is a small theme park and museum devoted to automatic musical instruments. Its main hall displays antique music boxes, mechanical organs and other automatic musical instruments mostly from European countries. The largest of them is a French fairground organ from 1905 which takes up an entire hall and plays every 30 minutes. The main building also houses a concert hall where classical musicians from around the world perform.

The park outside encloses European-style gardens with good views of [Mount Fuji](e2172.html) across the lake. Walking paths lead among the garden's manicured lawns and winding canal, connecting the museums's cafe, shops, chapel and rose garden. The Music Forest is run by the Ukai Group, which also operates the [Glass Forest](e5215.html), a Venetian glass museum in [Hakone](e5200.html).

The [Omni Bus Red Line](e6905.html) (Kawaguchiko Line) connects Kawaguchiko Station and the Kawaguchiko Music Forest (25 minutes). Get off at Ukai Orugoruno Mori Bijutsukan.
