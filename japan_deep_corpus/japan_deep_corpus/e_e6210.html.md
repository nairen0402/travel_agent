The entire eastern side of [Ibaraki Prefecture](/list/e1211.html) faces the Pacific Ocean, and the [beaches](e2461.html) that line the coast typically have shallow waters, are wide and spacious, and do not feel as crowded compared to the ones [closer to Tokyo](e3076.html). The tides tend to be strong, drawing surfers and body boarders. Note that children are not allowed to enter the waters on their own at most of the beaches as the currents may take them out despite the shallow waters.

The swimming season in Ibaraki is typically from mid July through August, very similar to the season at other [beaches around Tokyo](e3076.html). Beach huts and rental shops can be found at or near many beaches and are typically open only during the swimming season. These places provide beachgoers with showers, changing rooms, shaded rest areas, food and drinks. Lifeguards patrol the beaches during the summer swimming season.

  15 minutes by car or taxi from Omika Station

The beach is popular with families for swimming and body boarding. Public facilities include outdoor showers and toilets, and there are beach huts and rental shops offering parasols and large floats.

  Ajigaura Beach

  Five minute walk from Ajigaura Station

  The approximately 1.5 kilometer long Ajigaura Beach offers ample space for beach goers without feeling too cramped. Swimming and body boarding are popular activities as well as sunbathing. Beach huts and rental shops offer food, parasols and warm shower facilities.
* 

  Oarai Sun Beach•

  20 minute walk or five minute bus ride from Oarai Station

  Oarai Sun Beach is one of the biggest beaches (if not the biggest) in [Ibaraki Prefecture](/list/e1211.html). The massive beach has shallow waters that stretch for a long distance, and there are many beach huts and rental shops offering warm showers, food and beach equipment. Free toilets and outdoor showers are also available. The beach is close to the Oarai Seaside Station, a shopping mall with restaurants.
* 

  Nikkawa Beach

  15 minutes by car or taxi from Shimosa-Tachibana Station

  Nikkawa Beach is almost at the southern end of [Ibaraki Prefecture](/list/e1211.html), and is a relatively wide beach with views of the nearby wind turbines. In addition to swimming and sunbathing, surfing is also a popular activity here. Beach huts offer food and rent out floats and parasols. Free parking is provided to those arriving by [car](e2024.html).
* 

  Hasaki Beach

  Ten minutes by bus from Choshi Station, followed by a five minute walk

  Hasaki Beach is the southernmost beach in [Ibaraki Prefecture](/list/e1211.html). The large and wide beach has shallow waters that stretch for a long distance. Surfing and body boarding are popular activities in addition to swimming and sunbathing. Beach huts and rental shops offer food and beach equipment, and public facilities include toilets and outdoor showers. Parking is free at Hasaki Beach.

A few of the popular [beaches](e2461.html) in [Ibaraki](/list/e1211.html) are easily accessed by public transportation, but many of them are better accessed by [car](e2024.html). For those who are arriving by [car](e2022.html), note that limited paid parking may be found nearby with daily rates starting from 1000 yen or at hourly parking spots located further away.

[Mito City](e6200.html) lies roughly in the middle of [Ibaraki Prefecture](/list/e1211.html), not far from the coastline. The city's main station, Mito Station, is connected with central Tokyo (Ueno, Tokyo and Shinagawa stations) by frequently departing trains along the JR Joban Line (about 2 hours, 2310 yen one way). [Limited express](e2016.html) trains reduce the journey to about 80 minutes, but costs around 4000 yen one way. The trains are covered by the [Japan Rail Pass](e2361.html) and [Tokyo Wide Pass](e2361_06.html). From Mito Station, the JR Joban Line continues further north into the prefecture while the Kashimarinkai Railway connects to the southern coastline.
