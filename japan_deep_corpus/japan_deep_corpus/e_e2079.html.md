Nijushi no Hitomi Movie Village

Japanese movies (邦画, Hōga) have been produced in Japan for more than a century. From the days of silent movies during the [Meiji Period](e2130.html), the domestic movie industry has come a long way and today produces films with advanced film-making technologies. Japan is also renowned for producing popular [animated films](e2070.html).

Japanese movies can be seen at movie theaters across the country, which are often multi-screen complexes found in shopping centers and malls. Western movies are also shown at movie theaters, although typically a little bit delayed from their official releases in the West. These movies are usually offered subtitled or dubbed in [Japanese](e621.html). The typical price for watching a movie at the theater is 2000 yen.

Here is a list of destinations where you can enjoy movie-related attractions in Japan, as well as a couple of entries that introduce filming locations of award-winning movies shot in Japan:
