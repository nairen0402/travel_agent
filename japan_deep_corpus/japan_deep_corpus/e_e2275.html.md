Tour packages are travel plans, which include some or all of the following: [transportation](e627.html), [accommodation](e2025.html), meals, guided tours and more. They can be of great value to both, independent and group travelers.

Tour packages range from individual travel plans, which include only a [train ticket](e2359.html) and [hotel](e2025.html) reservation and leave everything else to the traveler, to fully guided tours which cover everything from [airfare](e2034.html) to English speaking guides and meals. Furthermore, there is a range of special interest tours, such as [anime](e2070.html), [hot spring](e2292.html), [hiking](e2427.html) or [theme park](e2067.html) tours.

Many companies inside and outside of Japan offer tour packages. Because the companies purchase tickets and [hotel rooms](e2025.html) in large bulks, they are able to offer the packages at costs far below the ones available to individual travelers, making tour packages an option worth considering by travelers of all [budgets](e2410.html).
