Eiheiji (永平寺) is a large [temple](e2058.html) complex and active monastery standing on a cedar-covered slope in the mountains just outside [Fukui City](e6600.html). The temple was founded in 1244 by Dogen, the Buddhist scholar who introduced Soto Zen from China to Japan in [1228](e2133.html). Eiheiji is one of two head temples of the Soto Sect of [Zen Buddhism](e2055.html) (the other was formerly [Sojiji Temple](e4260.html) on the [Noto Peninsula](e4250.html) before its head functions were transferred to [Yokohama](e2156.html)).

The sizable [temple](e2058.html) complex consists of over 70 buildings, which are connected to each other by covered walkways that protect from the heavy snow seen in the region from December to March. The warmer months bring lush vegetation to the temple grounds, which are especially beautiful from late October to early November when the [autumn colors](e2014.html) typically peak.

Looking down the slope of Eiheiji Temple

Visitors enter Eiheiji through the **reception hall** (Kichijokaku), a modern temple building for laypeople, with its own kitchen, bath, sleeping quarters, study rooms and a large meditation hall adorned by a beautifully decorated, coffered ceiling. Visitors first receive a short orientation about the [temple](e2055.html) in [Japanese](e621.html) before they can explore the temple grounds on their own. Good foreign language pamphlets are available that describe the various buildings.

Covered walkways lead from the reception hall to the temple's more historically significant buildings including the **Sanmon Gate**, which was rebuilt in 1749 and is the oldest standing building on the grounds today; the **Buddha Hall** (Butsuden) at the center of the complex, which houses statues of the past, present and future [Buddha](e2055.html); the spacious **main lecture hall** (Hatto) at the top of the slope; and the **founder's hall** (Joyoden), which contains the ashes of Dogen and images of Eiheiji's successive head monks.

A few other significant buildings can only be viewed from the outside, including the **monks' quarters** (Sodo), where the monks eat, sleep and meditate; the **kitchen** (Daikuin) where the meals for the monks are prepared; and the **baths and toilets** (Yokushitsu and Tosu), as bathing is an important cleansing ritual in Soto Zen Buddhism. In addition, a beautiful belfry can be seen below the Sanmon Gate, holding a giant bronze bell which is rung four times per day.

The view from the Sanmon Gate

There are hourly direct [buses](e2015.html) between Fukui Station and Eiheiji, taking 30 minutes and costing 750 yen one way. Alternatively, there are two connections per hour by the Echizen Railway from Fukui Station to Eiheiji-guchi Station (25 minutes, 490 yen one way), where you can transfer to a bus to Eiheiji (15 minutes, 430 yen).

Those approaching Fukui from the north (e.g. from [Kanazawa](e2167.html) or [Kaga Onsen](e4275.html)) can consider getting off the train at Awara Onsen (one stop before Fukui by [limited express](e2016.html) train) and transfer to a bus to Eiheiji (60 minutes, 1150 yen, every 2 hours).
