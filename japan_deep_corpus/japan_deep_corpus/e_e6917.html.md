Chureito Pagoda in spring

The Chureito Pagoda (忠霊塔, Chūreitō) is a five storied pagoda on the mountainside overlooking Fujiyoshida City and [Mount Fuji](e2172.html) off in the distance. The pagoda is part of the Arakura Sengen Shrine and was built as a peace memorial in 1963 nearly 400 steps up the mountain from the [shrine](e2059.html)'s main buildings.

The location offers spectacular views of Mount Fuji in combination with the pagoda, especially during the [cherry blossom](e2011.html) season in mid April when there are hundreds of trees in bloom and during the [autumn color](e2014.html) season which usually takes place in the first half of November. The spot is particularly popular among photographers as it allows for some wonderfully stereotypical shots of Japan.

Entrance to Arakura Sengen Shrine in autumn

Arakura Sengen Shrine is a ten minute walk from Shimo-Yoshida Station along the Fujikyu Railway Line (35 minutes, 980 yen from Otsuki or 10 minutes, 310 yen from Kawaguchiko). The pagoda is an additional five minute walk up the hill.
