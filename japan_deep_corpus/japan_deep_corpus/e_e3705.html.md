The Fujita Memorial Japanese Garden (藤田記念庭園, Fujita Kinen Teien) was built in 1919 in the style of a traditional [Japanese landscape garden](e2099.html). The spacious garden is separated into two main parts, an upper section and a lower section. It is named after its first owner, a local business man named Fujita Kenichi.

A few buildings of interest stand around the garden, including a traditional Japanese house in the upper section and a [tea ceremony](e2096.html) house in the lower section, both designed to afford views onto the surrounding landscape. Near the garden's entrance gate stand a small archeology museum and a Western house with tearoom from the Taisho era (1912-1926).

The Western House

Fujita Memorial Garden is located southwest of [Hirosaki Park](e3700.html), a 15 minute bus ride west of JR Hirosaki Station by the [Dotemachi Loop Bus](e3702.html#section_orientation). Get off at Shiyakusho-mae bus stop from where the garden can be reached in a five minute walk.
