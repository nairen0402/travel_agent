The Satsuma Peninsula (薩摩半島, Satsuma Hantō) extends about 50 kilometers south from [Kagoshima City](e4600.html), making up the southwestern section of [Kagoshima Prefecture](/list/e1246.html). Named after the former Satsuma feudal domain (roughly equivalent to modern day Kagoshima Prefecture), the peninsula offers a mixture of [hot springs](e2292.html), subtropical natural attractions and cultural sites.
