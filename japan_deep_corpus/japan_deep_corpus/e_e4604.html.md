Covered by: [Japan Rail Pass](/e/e2361.html)

[Tokyo](e2164.html) and [Kagoshima](e4600.html) are connected with each other by the [Tokaido, Sanyo and Kyushu Shinkansen](e2018.html). One transfer of trains is required along the way, typically at Shin-Osaka or Hakata Station. The one way trip takes about seven hours and costs around 32,000 yen. The [Japan Rail Pass](e2361.html) fully covers the trip if done by the slower [Hikari](e2018_tokaido.html) and [Sakura](e2018_sanyo.html) trains, but a supplement fee is required on the [Nozomi](e2018_sanyo.html) and [Mizuho](e2018_sanyo.html) trains.

Above fees and schedules are subject to change. Be sure to check current yen [exchange rates](e2196.html).

Kagoshima's main train station is **Kagoshima Chuo Station**, while **Kagoshima Station** is a smaller station on the opposite side of the city center. Located halfway between the two stations, **Tenmonkan** is considered Kagoshima's central downtown area. There are **two tram lines** which serve both railway stations and provide quick and convenient service in the downtown area. One ride costs 170 yen regardless of the distance traveled.

In March 2025, a new railway station, Senganen Station, was opened, greatly improving access to the [garden of the same name](e4602.html).

Kagoshima also has a [bus](e2015.html) network, which provides access to sites not served by trains and trams. The **City View Bus** is particularly useful for tourists, connecting Kagoshima Chuo Station with [Senganen Garden](e4602.html), [Shiroyama Park](e4607.html) and the ferry terminal to [Sakurajima](e4601.html). It runs every 30 minutes and costs 230 yen per ride or 600 yen for unlimited use on one calendar day.

The **Cute Pass** provides unlimited use of trams, the City View Bus, the Sakurajima Island View Bus, other city-operated buses and the Sakurajima Ferry on one or two consecutive calendar days. The 1-day pass costs 1300 yen, while the 2-day pass costs 1900 yen. The pass also includes discounts at some tourist facilities.

**Kagoshima Airport** is located quite far outside the city center, and is most easily accessed by airport buses, which stop at a number of locations within the city, including Kagoshima Chuo Station and Tenmonkan. The one way ride takes 40-60 minutes and costs 1500 yen.

There are four separate **ferry terminals** across the Kagoshima Port area for ferries leaving to nearby and faraway destinations (see map above): about one bus per hour connects Kagoshima Chuo Station with the various terminals for ferries to [Sakurajima](e4601.html) and [Yakushima](e4650.html) (15 minutes, 160 yen one way). Ferries for [Okinawa](/list/e1247.html) can be reached by the "Port Liner" bus which connects Kagoshima Chuo Station with Kagoshima New Port (20 minutes, 180 yen one way) once per day, timed to the ferries' departures and arrivals. All of the above-mentioned buses also stop at Tenmonkan in the city center along the way.
