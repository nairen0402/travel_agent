Tottori City (鳥取), the capital of [Tottori Prefecture](/list/e1231.html), is located in western Japan along the coast of the Sea of Japan. Tottori is most famous for its [sand dunes](e8102.html), the largest in Japan, which cover over 30 square kilometers of coast to the north of the city center.

Tottori City has been the regional seat of power since the [era of warring states](e2134.html), and the ruins of the former [castle](e8103.html) can still be found at the northeastern edge of the city center. A variety of [museums](e8105.html) and [Kannon-in Temple](e8104.html) are also located around central Tottori.
