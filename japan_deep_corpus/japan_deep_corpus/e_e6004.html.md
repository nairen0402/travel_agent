Located a short walk from [Zenkoji Temple](e6001.html), the Nagano Prefectural Art Museum (長野県立美術館, Nagano-kenritsu Bijutsukan) stages rotating exhibitions of fine art with different themes. The respective art works are done mostly by artists who were born in or related to [Nagano Prefecture](/list/e1216.html) or depict beautiful local scenery.

In 1990, the **Higashiyama Kaii Gallery** was built adjacent to the museum. It exhibits works of Higashiyama Kaii, who was impressed with the scenery of [Nagano](/list/e1216.html) and drew many landscape paintings of it. Rotating exhibitions of his work are held according to the seasons.

The museum and the gallery are a five minute walk northeast of [Zenkoji Temple](e6001.html).
