Sapporo Station (South Side)

Sapporo Station (札幌駅, Sapporo-eki) is the city's main [railway](e2019.html) station located right downtown. Multiple shopping centers surround the station complex, particularly on its south side. Sapporo Station dates back to the early development of [Hokkaido](/list/e1101.html) in the [late 1800s](e2130.html), but its current building was opened in 2003. A replica of the original station building can be found at the [Historic Village of Hokkaido](e5303.html).

The area's most impressive tourist attraction is the **T38 Observation Deck** at the top of the JR Tower building that rises above the station. Occupying the tower's 38th floor, 160 meters above ground, the observation deck is quite a bit taller than the 90 meter observation deck of the TV Tower in nearby [Odori Park](e5301.html). Great effort was put into the observation deck's design, including the viewing areas, information displays, music and even the washrooms.

Sapporo Station stands in the center of [Sapporo](e2163.html) and is served by all JR lines and two of the city's three subway lines. The Sapporo Station Bus Terminal is found to the southeast of the station, while many additional [bus](e2015.html) stops are located both on both sides of the station.
