Unlimited use of trains operated by [JR East](e2019.html) in the [Kanto](/list/e1103.html) (Tokyo, Kanagawa, Chiba, Saitama, Gunma, Tochigi and Ibaraki Prefectures) and [Tohoku](/list/e1102.html) (Fukushima, Miyagi, Yamagata, Akita, Iwate and Aomori Prefectures) regions and JR Hokkaido trains in southern Hokkaido (as far as [Sapporo](e2163.html)). The pass is also valid on the Tokyo Monorail which connects central Tokyo with [Haneda Airport](e2430.html).

Only the following non-JR train lines can also be used with the JR East South Hokkaido Rail Pass:
