Nioza Historical Road

[Usuki](e4740.html)'s [samurai](e2127.html) district is located at its city center, and parts of it retain the flavor of an old [castle](e2296.html) town with their stone paved alleys lined by pre-modern-looking houses.

The main attraction is the **Nioza Historical Road**, a 200 meter photogenic narrow alley which runs along [temples](e2058.html) and residences built in [Edo Period](e2128.html) style architecture, invoking a feeling of the past. Parallel to it runs the "Haccho Oji" Shopping Street, a merchant street with a neighborhood atmosphere, lined by shops selling crafts, local specialties, groceries and sundries. Walking westwards for about five minutes takes you to Ryugenji, a common temple except for its nice three-storied pagoda.

A room in the Inaba Residence

The local [feudal lord](e2127.html) of Usuki during the [Edo Period](e2128.html) was of the Inaba Clan. Today visitors can visit the **Inaba Residence**, where the family used to live whenever they returned to visit their hometown after they had moved to [Tokyo](e2164.html) during the [Meiji Period](e2130.html). The beautiful wooden residence is set in a tranquil ambience, with simple and elegant interior design, several [tatami](e2007.html) mat rooms, wide corridors and a nice [garden](e2099.html). Another [samurai](e2127.html) residence open to public is the **Marumo Residence**, situated at the southern end of the town center.

The Ruins of Usuki Castle are located on the eastern side of the district, and currently a neighborhood park is located on the former castle grounds. Unfortunately, most of the [castle](e2296.html) buildings including the main keep have been destroyed over the years, and today the only prominent structures remaining are a turret and a gate standing along the park's entrance.

Daimon Gate of the former Usuki Castle

The attractions of the samurai district are all located within walking distance of Usuki and Kami-Usuki Stations. It takes about 10-15 minutes to walk to the Nioza Historical Road from either stations.
