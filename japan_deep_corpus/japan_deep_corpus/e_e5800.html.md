Matsue (松江) is the capital city of [Shimane Prefecture](/list/e1237.html), attractively located at the eastern shores of Lake Shinji (Shinjiko). Due to its location between Lake Shinji, Nakaumi (another lake) and the Sea of Japan, Matsue is also known as the "water city".

Matsue's attractions include its original [castle](e5801.html) and the [former residence of Lafcadio Hearn](e5803.html). The city is also a good base to visit nearby [Izumo Taisha](e5804.html), one of Japan's most important [shrines](e2059.html) and the [Adachi Museum of Art](e5806.html) with one of Japan's most beautiful [landscape gardens](e2099.html).
