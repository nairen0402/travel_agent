**The 2026 festival is scheduled to be held from February 7 to 14.**

The Otaru Snow Light Path Festival (小樽雪あかりの路, Otaru Yuki Akari no Michi) is a winter [festival](e2063.html) held every February in [Otaru](e6700.html), during which the city becomes decorated in lights and small snow statues. The festival usually runs at a similar time as the nearby [Sapporo Snow Festival](e5311.html), making it possible for travelers in [Hokkaido](/list/e1101.html) to visit both festivals on the same trip.

The combination of the snowy town and the glittering lanterns creates a very pleasant atmosphere. The main festival venues get lit up daily from 17:00 to 21:00 and include the Unga venue, the Temiyasen venue and the Tenguyama venue. In addition, many locals also put lantern displays in front of their shops and residences, which further adds to the festival spirit. The venues, except the ropeway-accessible Tenguyama venue, are located within walking distance of the train station.

Illuminated snow sculptures in the canal area

The **Unga venue** is the most prominent venue, located along 300 meters of the town's iconic [Otaru Canal](e6701.html) (Otaru Unga). The restored warehouses and gas lamps along the canal make for a romantic setting, and the canal itself is covered with small buoys that hold candles. Along the path beside the water there is a row of small snow statues that also hold candles. The canal is about a ten minute walk from Otaru Station along the main road leading from the station.

Between the canal and the train station is the **Temiyasen venue**, which stretches for about half a kilometer along the tracks of the abolished Temiyasen railway line. During the festival, the pleasant pathway gets lined by many lanterns and illuminated snow statues, as well as a few food stands. The **Tenguyama venue** is located at the upper ropeway station on Mount Tenguyama, which overlooks the city with spectacular views.

Small snow sculptures along the Temiyasen venue

The Unga venue beside [Otaru Canal](e6701.html) is a ten minute walk straight down the main road from Otaru Station, while the Temiyasen venue lies about half way between the station and the canal, running parallel to the canal. The Tenguyama venue is located around the upper station of the Tenguyama Ropeway (1600 yen round trip), whose lower station can be accessed from Otaru Station in a 20 minute ride by bus number 9 (240 yen one way, every 30 minutes).
