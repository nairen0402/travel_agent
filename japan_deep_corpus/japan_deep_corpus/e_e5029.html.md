Sunrise at Jodogahama Beach

Jodogahama Beach (浄土ヶ浜, Jōdogahama, lit. "Pure Land Beach") is a beautiful [beach](e2461.html) just outside of central [Miyako City](e5044.html) in [Iwate Prefecture](/list/e1204.html). It is one of the more famous tourist sites along the [Sanriku Coast](e5025.html) and part of the [Sanriku Recovery National Park](e2325.html).

Jodogahama features a beautiful white pebble shoreline and clear, calm waters punctuated by jagged, rocky islands. This memorable landscape invokes images of the "Pure Land", a Buddhist concept of paradise, which the beach derives its name from.

Ranked one of the one hundred best [beaches](e2461.html) and swimming spots in Japan, Jodogahama Beach is particularly popular in summer. It attracts visitors with its clear inlet that is sheltered from the open ocean. A rest house near the beach provides showers, toilets, changing rooms, a shop and a dining hall. The rest house and several other tourist facilities in the area were destroyed by the [2011 tsunami](e5027.html), but were rebuilt in the meantime.

A **visitor center** is located at the main parking lot of Jodogahama Beach. The center has a small, free museum about the coastline and its natural features. Several short walking trails lead from the visitor center to the beach, the boat piers, to several viewpoints in the surrounding pine forests and to a fishery museum with lots of displays about the historical and modern fishing methods used in the local waters.

Two different boat cruises are offered around Jodogahama. The large **Umineko-maru sightseeing ship** not only provides views of the coast but also provides a transportation link between Jodogahama and the Minato Oasis Michi no eki roadside station in Miyako's fishing port. The small boats of the **Blue Cave Cruises** give visitors a close up view of the sharp, rocky islands opposite Jodogahama Beach and also visits the Blue Cave (Aonodokutsu), a small cave that is accessible only from the sea and is named for its cobalt blue water. All cruises get accompanied by the local seagulls (umineko).

Blue Cave Cruise

Iwate Kenpoku Bus operates 1-2 [buses](e2015.html) per hour between [Miyako Station](e5044.html) and Jodogahama. All buses stop at the Jodogashima Visitor Center (15 minutes, 200 yen one way), and selected buses go further to the actual beach at the Oku-Jodogahama bus stop (20 minutes, 250 yen). Many of the buses also stop at the Minato Oasis Michi no eki roadside station.

The beach is a 10-15 minute walk from the Jodogashima Visitor Center. The road leading from the main parking lot to the beach is closed to private vehicles from April through October. A shuttle bus operates to the beach every 30 minutes during the busy seasons.
