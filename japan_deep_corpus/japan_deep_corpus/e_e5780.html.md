The Nariwa Museum (成羽美術館, Nariwa Bijutsukan) is an art museum in Nariwa Town, not far from [Takahashi](e5775.html). Designed by world renowned [architect](e2111_architects.html) Ando Tadao in 1994, the museum features his distinct style of utilising unvarnished concrete combined with sharp lines.

The main exhibition at Nariwa Museum displays paintings by Nariwa-born, Western-style painter Kojima Torajiro (1881-1929) and ancient Egyptian items from Kojima's private collection. Kojima's works can also be seen in [Kurashiki](e5750.html) at the [Ohara Museum](e5754.html).

Also on permanent display is a selection of fossils uncovered from the Nariwa region, which is known to be the location of one of Japan's oldest forests over 200 million years ago. Rounding up the museum is a small museum shop and cafe which offers views of the inner water garden.
