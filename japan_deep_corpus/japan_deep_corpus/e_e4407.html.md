Oura Church (大浦天主堂, Ōura Tenshudō) is a Catholic church in [Nagasaki](e2162.html). Built towards the end of the [Edo Period](e2128.html) in 1864 by a French missionary for the growing community of foreign merchants in the city, it is considered the oldest standing [Christian](e2298.html) church in Japan.

Oura Church is dedicated to the memory of the [26 Christians who were executed](e4417.html) in the city in 1597. Today, the working church stands as an attractive example of contemporary European architecture, drawing many visitors. The church was the first Western-style building in Japan to be designated as a national treasure. The steep admission fee includes entrance to a museum about the history of [Christianity in Japan](e2298.html).

Located in attractive old buildings to the right of the church, the **Christian Museum** contains various exhibitions pertaining to the history of Oura Church and Christianity in [the region](/list/e1240.html) and across Japan, with various artifacts and old documents on display. Explanations are predominantly in Japanese.

The entrance to the Christian Museum

Oura Church is a five minute walk from the Ouratenshudo tram station on tram line number 5. It stands just next to the entrance of [Glover Garden](e4406.html).
