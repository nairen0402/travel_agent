Main Hall

Tokeiji (東慶寺, Tōkeiji) is a small branch [temple](e2058.html) of the Engakuji school within the Rinzai sect of [Zen Buddhism](e2055.html). Its head temple, the [Engakuji Temple](e3103.html), stands just a few hundred meters away on the opposite side of the railway tracks. Photography is prohibited on the temple grounds.

Tokeiji was founded by the wife of the regent [Hojo Tokimune](e2133.html) in [1285](e2133.html) after Tokimune had died at a young age. Until the end of the [Edo Period](e2128.html) (1603-1868), the temple served as a shelter for women who suffered abuse by their husbands and sought a divorce. An official divorce could be attained by staying at the temple for three years.

Tokeiji is a five minute walk from Kita-Kamakura Station on the JR Yokosuka Line, one station before Kamakura Station when coming from [Tokyo](e2164.html).
