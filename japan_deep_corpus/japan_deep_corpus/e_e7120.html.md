Hiji Waterfall

Important Notice:

Updated: December 1, 2025

The hiking trail to Hiji Waterfall and the camping ground at the trailhead were severely damaged by heavy rain in autumn 2024 and remain closed. It will take an extended period of time to repair the damage, and a reopening date is currently unknown.

Hiji Waterfall (比地大滝, Hiji Ōtaki) is located in the [Yambaru area](e7131.html) of northern [Okinawa Honto](e7101.html), where the population density is low and the majority of land is covered by forests. The waterfall can be accessed in an attractive and easy hike along a nature trail through the forest.

The trailhead is about two kilometers inland from the main road along the island's western coast. At the trailhead there is a gate where an entrance fee must be paid. From there, the distance to the waterfall is about 1.5 kilometers, and the hike takes about 40 minutes one way. The trail is well maintained, and there are a few steep sections with stairs along the way. One of the highlights of the walk is crossing a suspension bridge that spans a valley 17 meters below.

The trail comes to an end at the Hiji Waterfall, which makes an impressive sight. Nestled in the forest, the waterfall is about 26 meters tall. The sound of the running water and the tranquil atmosphere of the forest make it a good spot for a rest before making the return trip.

At the trailhead there is a campground that visitors can make use of as an alternative to visiting Hiji in a day trip. The campground offers picnic tables and elevated wooden decks which tents can be set up on. Camping costs 2000 yen per tent site per night.

Because of the [Yambaru area](e7131.html)'s small population there has been much less human encroachment on the habitat of the area's wildlife than elsewhere on [Okinawa Honto](e7101.html). Accordingly, a much larger diversity of wildlife can be found in the area. Travelers who keep alert of their surroundings will have the chance to see a number of animals unique to the area, such as particular species of birds, turtles, snakes and lizards.

Information about the local wildlife and hiking trails can be found at the nearby **Yambaru Wildlife Conservation Center** (currently temporarily closed for renovations until 2026), which is located about one kilometer inland from the main road along the coastline. The museum has illustrative maps and displays about the area's wildlife and is free to enter.

Hiji Waterfall is located in northern [Okinawa Honto](e7101.html), about 75 kilometers from [Naha](e7102.html) and not far from [Okuma Beach](e7119.html#okumabeach).

### By bus

Take [highway bus](e2366.html) number 111 or 117 or the Yanbaru Express from Naha to Nago Bus Terminal (90 minutes, 1550-2420 yen from Naha Bus Center; 105 minutes, 1650-2520 yen from Naha Airport; 1-2 buses/hour) and transfer to [bus](e2015.html) number 67 to Okuma Beach Iriguchi (奥間ビーチ入口, 60 minutes, 1160 yen, hourly) from where the trailhead is a 20-25 minute walk inland along the road. Note that between Naha and Nago the Yanbaru Express is cheaper than the other buses and that it stops at the Kencho Kitaguchi bus stop instead of the Naha Bus Center.

### By car

By [car](e2024.html), it takes about two hours to reach the small parking lot next to the trailhead from central [Naha](e7102.html) if using the [expressway](e2354.html) between Naha and Nago (1040 yen one way).
