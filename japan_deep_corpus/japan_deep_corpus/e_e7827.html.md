Iya Valley

The Iya Valley (祖谷渓, Iyakei) is a secluded, mountainous valley along the Iya River in western [Tokushima Prefecture](/list/e1234.html). Its steep forested slopes are connected to the outside world by a winding, sometimes unbelievably narrow mountain road that navigates the valley. While the deeper parts of the Iya Valley may be difficult to access, this remoteness is what draws visitors to the area to experience a traditional, rural culture that is difficult to find in modern Japan.

Historically the Iya Valley has been a difficult place to enter and has long served as a refuge for members of the defeated Taira Clan (also known as Heike) who escaped to the region toward the end of the 12th century after losing the [Gempei War](e2132.html) (1180-1185). Their descendants can still be found around the tiny mountain villages that dot the region.

In more recent times, the Iya Valley has been promoted by **Alex Kerr**, author of "Lost Japan", who fell in love with the area after a visit in 1971. He bought and restored an old farmhouse, Chiiori, which is now operated as a lodging to introduce people to traditional Japanese life. Kerr was later also involved in opening up an entire collection of restored traditional homes, known as the Togenkyo Iya, as tourist lodgings in a village along the steep valley.

The Iya Valley is commonly divided into two areas. **Nishi Iya** (West Iya) around the entrance to the valley is slightly more developed and more accessible with relatively frequent [buses](e2015.html) to some of the major attractions. **Oku Iya** (Inner Iya, also called Higashi Iya or East Iya) lies further back into the valley and is difficult to reach without a [rental car](e2024.html) or other means of private transportation. The following attractions are listed relative to their location within the valley.

### Nishi Iya

* 

  Manikin Peeing Boy Statue

  At the edge of this dizzying, 200 meter high cliff stands the statue of a boy posed as if he were peeing off the ledge down to the valley bellow. The statue is located at a beautiful scenic spot a few steps from The Iya Onsen Hotel, where local folklore says passing travelers would climb out to pee off as a testament to their bravery. A railing discourages visitors from attempting this dangerous act today.

  In the past, 13 suspension bridges constructed of mountain vines served as the main means of crossing the Iya River. Only three such bridges still exist, of which [Iya Kazurabashi](e7828.html) is the largest and most easily accessible. The 45 meters long bridge stretches 14 meters above the river and is reinforced with hidden steel cables for safety.

### Oku Iya

  This restored [samurai](e2127.html) residence high up in the valley's steep slope is the former home of the Kita Clan, local leaders. It displays a set of samurai armor, as well as tools and implements necessary for daily life in the remote village. A rental car is recommended to access the house, as the nearest bus stop is about a 45 minute walk away.

  [Oku-Iya Kazurabashi Bridges](e7829.html)

  [Two more vine bridges](e7829.html) stand side by side deep in the Iya Valley near [Mount Tsurugi](e7830.html). Dubbed the husband and wife bridges, the taller and longer bridge is the Otto no Hashi (husband bridge), and the slightly smaller one is the Tsuma no Hashi (wife bridge). Near the wife bridge is a wooden cable cart used for transporting goods across the river.

  [Mount Tsurugi](e7830.html)

  [Mount Tsurugi](e7830.html) (1955 meters) stands at the far end of the Iya Valley. Visitors can take a chairlift most of the way up the mountain to a station from where it is an easy 30 minute hike to the summit.

Nishi Iya is accessible by [buses](e2015.html) from Awa Ikeda Station (one bus every 2-3 hours) and Oboke Station (one bus every 1-2 hours). Some buses operate as far as Kubo in Oku Iya, where travelers can transfer to a bus further into the valley. The [Oku-Iya Kazurabashi Bridges](e7829.html) and [Mount Tsurugi](e7830.html) are served only on weekends and during peak seasons from April to November.

A [rental car](e2024.html) is recommended, especially for visiting the less traveled Oku Iya area. Note that the roads are very narrow and have frequent blind curves, which makes driving both hazardous and slow. A few rental outlets are available around Oboke and Awa-Ikeda stations.
