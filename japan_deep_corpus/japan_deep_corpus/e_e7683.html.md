The Osado Skyline (大佐渡スカイライン, Ōsado Skyline) is a scenic road through the Osado Mountains of northern [Sado Island](e7675.html), leading from Chigusa at the center of the island to the [Sado Gold Mine](e7678.html). The skyline is a winding, toll-free mountain road, that takes about one hour to drive and offers panoramic views of the island from a number of vantage points.

About halfway along the way is an aging rest area with a viewing deck, restaurant and toilets. From there you can also reach the summit of Kinpokusan, Sado Island's highest peak in about a 90 minute walk. The entire Osado Skyline drive is only accessible by [car](e2024.html), as public [buses](e2015.html) do not travel along this route.
