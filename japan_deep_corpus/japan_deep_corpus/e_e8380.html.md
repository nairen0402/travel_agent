Ureshino Onsen (嬉野温泉) is a [hot spring](e2292.html) town in southwestern [Saga Prefecture](/list/e1241.html). Its clear [onsen](e2292.html) waters are high in sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride and feel extremely smooth on skin, giving rise to its popularity as a "Bihada no Yu" (lit. beautiful skin waters).

Visitors to Ureshino can try the local waters at the Siebold-No-Yu, a public bath house with gender-segregated pools, named after the 19th century German scientist who enjoyed bathing in the town during his stay in Japan. Furthermore, there are over 30 hotels and [ryokan](e2029.html), many of which open their [hot spring baths](e2292.html) to non-staying guests during the daytime for typically 600 to 1100 yen. Ureshino is also famous for its [tea](e2041.html) and boiled [tofu](e2045_tofu.html) (yudofu).
