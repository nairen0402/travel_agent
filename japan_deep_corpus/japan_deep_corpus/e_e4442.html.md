Central Fukue City seen from Mount Onidake

Fukue Island (福江島, Fukue-jima) is the largest and most populated of the [Goto Islands](e4440.html) and is home to the islands' largest town around the Port of Fukue in the east of the island. The entire island falls under the municipality of Goto City, which also covers Hisaka and Naru islands.

The island's hilly terrain plays host to various [churches](#church) and [temples](#temple) including the Goto Islands' oldest of both, as well as other historical sites, many of which are just a stone's throw from unspoiled nature spots. The natural beauty on the island includes but is not limited to [beaches](#takahama), craggy coastlines and [mountains](#onidake) from where great views can be had of some of the neighboring islands.

Takahama Beach

The town around the Port of Fukue with its selection of hotels, restaurants and shops serves as a convenient base from which to explore the islands. Here also stands a ruined [castle](e2296.html) that served as the seat of power from which the entire Goto fief was ruled during the [Edo Period](e2128.html). Today little of the castle remains save for a section of the old moat and an [old residence](#goto), with much of the grounds now covered by a school. Despite this, parts of the old castle and the adjacent [samurai district](#bukeyashiki), which has also been mostly superseded by modern construction, make for a pleasant place to stroll.

Some of Fukue's top attractions are listed below:

### Historical sites

Fukue boasts multiple sites related to the feudal lords who ruled over the islands during the [Edo Period](e2128.html) (1603-1868), especially around the centrally located, former castle:

* 

  Lord Goto Residence

  Open only on weekends and Mondays in spring (April to June) and autumn (September to November)  
  Hours: 9:00 to 17:00 (until 13:00 on Mondays)  
  Admission: 800 yen  
  Typical visit duration: 40 minutes

  This beautiful old residence is the highlight of the old [castle](e2296.html) grounds and contains a scenic [Japanese garden](e2099.html) in addition to the house, which has been brilliantly restored to its former grandeur from centuries ago. The house, which is of a style typical to that of a contemporary aristocrat, was resided in by the local lord during the [Edo Period](e2128.html). Unfortunately, it is open to the public only seasonally.
* 

  City Museum

  Hours: 9:00 to 17:00 (until 18:00 from Jun to Sep)  
  Closed: [New Year](e2276.html) holidays  
  Admission: 300 yen  
  Typical visit duration: 20 minutes

  Aside from the castle moat, which survives from old times, there are two mock buildings on the old [castle](e2296.html) grounds that resemble keeps. One of these buildings contains a museum in which there are various exhibitions relating to the history of the castle, as well as an exhibition pertaining to local history in general. The other building serves as the local library.
* 

  Bukeyashiki Samurai Street

  Hours: Always open  
  Closed: No closing days  
  Admission: Free  
  Typical visit duration: 20 minutes

  The area of the town where the [samurai](e2127.html) class lived during the [Edo Period](e2128.html), today the area's main street has been nicely paved to complement the surviving stone walls and odd surviving front gate that line the road. The street makes for a nice view, but behind the walls and gates, barely anything historical survives, having been supplanted by modern buildings.

### Churches

Around twenty churches have been built across the island of Fukue since the end of the [feudal era](e2128.html). Two of the most notable ones are listed below:

* 

  Dozaki Church

  Hours: 9:00 to 17:00 (until 16:00 from mid Nov to mid Mar)  
  Closed: [New Year](e2276.html) holidays  
  Admission: 300 yen  
  Typical visit duration: 20-30 minutes

  After the ban on [Christianity](e2298.html) was lifted in [1873](e2130.html), two French priests built this church as the first Western-style church on the Goto Islands. Today's incarnation was completed in 1908 and was dedicated to the [26 Martyrs](e4417.html) who were executed in [Nagasaki](e2162.html). Unlike most other churches on the island which primarily serve as working churches, Dozaki Church features a museum inside with exhibits about local Christian history.
* 

  Imochiura Church

  Hours: 9:00 to 17:00  
  Closed: No closing days  
  Admission: Free  
  Typical visit duration: 15 minutes

  Located in the far south of Fukue Island, Imochiura Church is housed in a beautiful brick building. Like many churches in the region, it features a statue of Our Lady of Lourdes together with a spring in its garden. However, the statue at Imochiura Church is considered the first of its kind in Japan.

### Kukai-related sites

Kukai, posthumously known as Kobo Daishi, is one of the most revered figures in Japanese history. He introduced the [Shingon](e4900.html) sect of [Buddhism](e2055.html) to Japan after studying in China in the early [9th century](e2132.html). On his way to and from China, Kukai spent some time on the Goto Islands which served as the last port of call on the journey to the continental mainland:

* 

  Daihoji Temple

  Hours: Vary  
  Closed: No closing days  
  Admission: Free  
  Typical visit duration: 30 minutes

  Kukai is believed to have visited this temple on his way back from studying in China in the early [9th century](e2132.html). Bringing [Shingon Buddhism](e2055.html) with him, he converted the priest to the religion and resultantly the temple came to be referred to as the [Koyasan](e4900.html) of the West, after what Kukai later founded as the headquarters of Shingon Buddhism. The temple is atypical in style and layout. Its architecture gives the temple a slightly Chinese aesthetic.
* 

  Myojoin Temple

  Hours: 9:00 to 17:00 (closed between 12:00 and 13:00)  
  Closed: Mondays, 1st and 28th of each month, [Obon](e2286.html), [New Year](e2276.html) holidays  
  Admission: Free  
  Typical visit duration: 20 minutes

  Myojoin Temple is the oldest [temple](e2058.html) on the Goto Islands. It is believed that Kukai stopped here on his way back from studying in China. Today visitors can look around the temple grounds and view 121 paintings of flowers and birds that adorn the ceiling of the main hall.
* 

  Cape Kashiwazaki

  Hours: Always open  
  Closed: No closing days  
  Admission: Free  
  Typical visit duration: 10 minutes

  Kukai and the Japanese envoys to Tang China made their last stop at a port around this cape before crossing the sea to the Asian mainland. Later, the area became an important center of whaling for the Goto fief. Today, however, only a remote village, nice views of the coast and a monument commemorating Kukai remain here.

### Nature

* 

  Takahama Beach

  Hours: Always open  
  Closed: No closing days  
  Admission: Free

  Arguably the most beautiful [beach](e2461.html) on Fukue, if not all the [Goto Islands](e4440.html), Takahama Beach provides blue waters and white sand for an idyllic backdrop for swimming and sunbathing. The beach is designated among Japan's 100 best and offers changing facilities and toilets.
* 

  Mount Onidake

  Hours: Always open  
  Closed: No closing days  
  Admission: Free

  A 315-meter-tall, dormant volcano that last erupted around 20,000 years ago, Onidake has become a symbol of the Goto Islands and is a popular place for [hiking](e2427.html). From its summit, which can be reached in around a 30 minute hike, great views can be enjoyed of the surrounding hills and coast and the nearby town center.
* 

  Osezaki Cape

  Osezaki is a cape with tall, craggy cliffs that offer visitors some spectacular views. At the end of the cape stands Osezaki Lighthouse that originally dates back to the [Meiji Period](e2130.html).
* 

  Abunze Coast

  Information center hours: 9:00 to 17:00 (until 18:00 in July and August)  
  Closed: [New Year](e2276.html) holidays  
  Admission: Free  
  Typical visit duration: 20 minutes

  Abunze Coast is made of lava rock just south of Onidake. It is believed that the lava arrived here following the eruption of Onidake around 20,000 years ago. Today, good views can be had of the rugged section of coastline, especially from an observation deck, down a short coastal trail. Next to the coast stands a small information center.

### How to get to Fukue Island

#### By air from Nagasaki or Fukuoka

Fukue Airport is served by multiple [flights](e2365.html) per day from [Nagasaki](e2162.html) and [Fukuoka](e2161.html). The flight takes around 40 minutes and cost around 8,000 to 19,000 yen one way. [Buses](e2015.html) connect the airport with the city center and Fukue Port (15 minutes, 310 yen one way) and are timed to flights.

#### By ferry from Nagasaki

Both [high-speed boats and car ferries](e2355.html) operate multiple times per day between [Nagasaki](e2162.html) and Fukue Port. By high speed boat, the one way journey takes 90 minutes and costs about 9000 yen, while by car ferry it takes around three hours and costs about 4000 yen. Some of the ferries stop on [Nakadori Island](e4443.html) along the way which increases travel time considerably. The cost to transport a regular-sized [car](e2024.html) is around 25,000 yen one way.

#### From other islands

A dense [ferry](e2355.html) network connects Fukue to the other islands in the [Goto Island](e4440.html) chain. The most important route connects Fukue Port with Narao Port on [Nakadori Island](e4443.html) and is served by [high-speed boats and car ferries](e2355.html) multiple times per day. By high-speed boat, the one way journey takes 30 minutes and costs around 2800 yen, while by car ferry it takes 60-90 minutes and costs around 1000 yen. The cost to transport a regular-sized [car](e2024.html) between the two islands is around 7000 yen.

### How to get around Fukue Island

Fukue Island is covered by a network of [bus](e2015.html) routes; however, these are predominantly for locals and generally don't serve the tourist sites. One exception are the buses that connect central Fukue with [Daihoji Temple](#daihoji) and [Imochiura Church](#imochiura), but even these services are infrequent.

It is for this reason that by far the most convenient way to get around Fukue Island is by [rental car](e2024.html). A few car rental outlets can be found around central Fukue which is close to both the port and airport. The island is relatively small and can be driven around in about half a day, with a few main roads connecting the different parts of the island and narrower, windy coastal roads.
