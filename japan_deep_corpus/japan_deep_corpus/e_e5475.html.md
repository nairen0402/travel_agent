Naoshima (直島) is an island in the [Seto Inland Sea](e5445.html) that is known for its [contemporary art](e2115.html) and serves as a main venue of the [Setouchi Triennale](e5410.html) art festival. Part of [Kagawa Prefecture](/list/e1233.html), the island with its Mediterranean atmosphere, sandy [beaches](e2461.html) and sunny weather, combined with a laid back, rural feel is a relaxing getaway from Japan's large urban areas.

Much of Naoshima's art was installed by the Benesse Corporation, which oversees art museums and installations on Naoshima and the nearby islands of [Teshima](e5440.html) and [Inujima](e5725.html). Many of Benesse's museums were designed by star [architect](e2111_architects.html) Ando Tadao and include the [Chichu Art Museum](e5477.html), [Lee Ufan Museum](e5482.html), [Naoshima New Museum of Art](e5484.html) and the [Benesse House](e5478.html).

In addition, Naoshima's municipal buildings and schools were designed by the modern architect Ishii Kazuhiro.
