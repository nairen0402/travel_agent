Held in spring (April 14-15) and autumn (October 9-10), the [Takayama Festival](e5909.html) ranks as one of Japan's three most beautiful [festivals](e2063.html) alongside [Kyoto](e2158.html)'s [Gion Matsuri](e3942.html) and the [Chichibu Matsuri](e6552.html).

Four of the autumn festival's eleven floats (yatai) are exhibited at the Takayama Matsuri Yatai Kaikan (高山祭屋台会館) next to Hachiman Shrine. The elaborately decorated floats are several hundred years old and beautiful examples of [Takayama](e5900.html)'s legendary craftsmanship.

Adjacent to the Matsuri Yatai Kaikan and included in the admission price is the Nikkokan, a spacious hall containing impressive models of the different buildings of [Toshogu Shrine](e3801.html) in [Nikko](e3800.html), one of the most ornate and celebrated [shrines](e2059.html) in the country. A famous carpenter credited with creating many of Toshogu's carvings is said to have had ties to Takayama.

The Nikkokan Hall

The Takayama Yatai Kaikan and the Nikkokan are located at the northern end of Takayama's [old town](e5903.html), a 20-25 minute walk from Takayama Station.
