The National Museum of Art, Osaka (国立国際美術館, Kokuritsu Kokusai Bijutsukan) occupies two underground floors on Nakanoshima Island in central [Osaka](e2157.html). The museum focuses on Japanese and foreign contemporary art with exhibitions from the museum's collection and special exhibitions.

The museum's current building was opened in 2007 and was designed to represent the growth and shape of a bamboo plant. The facility was formerly housed in the Expo Museum of Fine Arts, built for the [Osaka Expo in 1970](e4029.html).

The National Museum of Art is located on Nakanoshima Island directly adjacent to the [Osaka Science Museum](e4015.html). Take the Yotsubashi Subway Line to Higobashi Station, from where the museum can be reached in a 5-10 minute walk. Nakanoshima Station on the Keihan Nakanoshima Line is even closer.
