A room of private booths, booth doors can be closed for more privacy

Manga cafes (まんが喫茶, manga kissa, short for manga kissaten) are establishments where visitors can read from an extensive library of [manga](e2070.html) (Japanese comics). They also provide computers with [internet access](e2279.html), making them synonymous with internet cafes. Furthermore, manga kissa have become a popular [low budget accommodation](e2028_accommodation.html) option as many of them are open 24 hours and offer amenities such as showers and free drinks for around 2000 to 4000 yen per night. Some manga kissa offer women-only sections.

Manga kissa can be found in most cities across Japan. Many are located in side streets close to train stations. Big cities such as [Tokyo](e2164.html) and [Osaka](e2157.html) have a large number of such establishments. However, without [Japanese reading skills](e621.html) it can be difficult to identify a manga kissa as many do not have English signs and they are not usually located at street level, but on a higher floor in a multi-storey building.

The **cost** of staying at a manga kissa depends on the time spent there. Typically, the initial 30 minutes cost around 200 to 400 yen, and additional time is charged at a rate of about 100 yen per 10-15 minutes. Longer plans are commonly available: typically 3 hours for 1000-2000 yen, or 5-8 hours for 1500-3000 yen. Note that prices can be a little higher on weekends.

There are usually two **types of seats** available at manga kissa: open seats and private booths. Open seats are office chairs at a computer desk, while private booths are narrow partitioned cubicles with just enough space for a desk and either an office chair, reclining chair, flatbed chair or [futon](e2007.html). Some manga kissa also offer wider private booths that can accommodate two people or even larger family rooms; these tend to be comparatively more expensive.

Other facilities typically available at a manga kissa, in addition to an extensive [manga](e2070.html) (comic) collection, include free [Wi-Fi](e2279.html), unlimited soft drinks, paid showers (amenities sold separately), television, [movies](e2079.html), console games, dedicated online gaming computers, printers, CDs and DVDs, and [vending machines](e2010.html). Note that some of these extras require an additional fee. Manga kissa also commonly provide blankets, indoor slippers, web cameras, and phone and handheld game chargers for free. Snacks and food may also be sold at the front desk.

The **procedure to use a manga kissa** may seem intimidating at first, but it is essentially the same at most manga kissa across Japan. Some places even provide English check-in instructions at the counter or may have English speaking staff. It typically goes as follows:

1. Enter the building and take the elevator to the check-in floor.
2. A membership may be required to visit a manga kissa. If you don't have one yet, you can sign up for one on the spot for typically a few hundred yen. Photo ID, such as a passport, is usually required when filling out the membership form.
3. You will be asked to choose the type of seat or booth that you want, and the time plan that you intend to stay on. There is usually a price list at the counter that you can use to help make your decision. The plan that you choose determines the length of time that you are committed to pay for. Staying longer will incur additional charges.
4. The staff will issue you a membership card and hand you a payment slip that contains your name, seat or booth number and starting time.
5. Proceed to your seat or booth. When using a booth, you can close the curtain or door for privacy. The manga kissa is generally a quiet place and it is considered rude to make noise and disturb others. Requests for extra items should be made at the check-in counter.
6. When you decide to leave the manga kissa, take the payment slip to the the check-in counter and pay. The staff will tally the charge based on your seat or booth type, time plan and additional fees (if any).
