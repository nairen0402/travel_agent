Tokyo Skytree Town (東京スカイツリータウン) is a modern commercial complex in the Sumida District of [Tokyo](e2164.html) which opened in 2012. Located across the Sumida River from [Asakusa](e3004.html), Tokyo Skytree Town was built by Tobu Railway in conjunction with television broadcasters. At its center stands the [Tokyo Skytree](e3064.html), a 634 meter high television broadcasting tower and landmark of the city.

The base of Tokyo Skytree is made up mainly of [Tokyo Solamachi](e3064_solamachi.html), a shopping and entertainment complex with over 300 shops and restaurants. Tokyo Solamachi also features several plazas and green spaces from where you can admire the tower, as well as a planetarium and the [Sumida Aquarium](e3064_aquarium.html). To the east of the tower is the Skytree East Building office complex with restaurants on its top floors.
