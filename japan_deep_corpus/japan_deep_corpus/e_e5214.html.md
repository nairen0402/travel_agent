Entrance to the museum

The POLA group, a skin care and beauty products company, opened the POLA Museum of Art (ポーラ美術館, Pōla Bijutsukan) in 2002 in order to display the extensive private art collection of the company's late owner, Suzuki Tsuneshi.

The museum was built amid a forest of 300 year old beech trees, and although constructed of concrete and glass, it is designed so as not to disrupt the natural environment that surrounds it. To achieve this, the majority of the building is located underground.

The museum features modern and contemporary paintings, sculptures, ceramics and glassware by mostly Japanese and European artists. In addition to temporary exhibits, the museum displays rotating exhibits drawn from its permanent collection which include works by artists such as Cezanne, Monet, Picasso and Renoir.

The Atrium

The POLA Museum of Art is a short bus ride from Gora Station, the last stop of [Hakone Tozan Railways](e5202.html). Take a Hakone Tozan bus bound for Shissei Kaen and get off at the Pola Bijutsukan bus stop (15 minutes, 310 yen, 4-5 buses per hour, covered by the [Hakone Free Pass](e2358_008.html)).
