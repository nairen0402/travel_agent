The Boso Peninsula (房総半島, Bōsō Hantō) is the large peninsula just east of [Tokyo](e2164.html) across Tokyo Bay. With its mountainous interior and many beaches along its shoreline, the area comes with a resort-feel and is also popular for its [flowers](e6435.html) which start blooming as early as February.

No more than 15 kilometers away from Tokyo at its closest point, the Boso Peninsula is well connected to the city by [train](e2019.html), [bus](e2366.html) and [expressway](e2354.html). The fairly developed western coast faces Tokyo Bay and is connected to Tokyo via the Aqua Line expressway, a combination of tunnel and bridge. The more rural southern tip offers natural and historic sights and scenic views as far as [Mount Fuji](e2172.html) on clear days, while the eastern coast faces the Pacific Ocean and has [beaches](e2461.html) popular among surfers.
