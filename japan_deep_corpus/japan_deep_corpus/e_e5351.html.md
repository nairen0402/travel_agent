Old Hakodate Public Hall (upper building)

The harbor of [Hakodate](e5350.html) was one of the first to be opened to foreign trade in 1854 when Japan's [era of isolation](e2128.html) was coming to an end. As a result, many traders from Russia, China and Western countries moved to Hakodate. Motomachi, at the foot of [Mount Hakodate](e5354.html), became a district favored among the new foreign residents.

Many foreign-looking buildings remain in the area today. Among the most famous are the Russian Orthodox Church, the Old British Consulate, the Chinese Memorial Hall, the prefectural government's former branch office building and the old Hakodate Public Hall.

Hakodate Russian Orthodox Church

The Motomachi district is situated at the foot of [Mount Hakodate](e5354.html) and is easily accessed from Hakodate Station in a 5 minute tram ride or 20-30 minute walk.
