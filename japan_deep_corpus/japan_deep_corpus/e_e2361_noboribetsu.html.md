### Seat reservations

Free seat reservations can be made at seat reservation ticket machines in Hokkaido and at JR ticket offices. It is also possible to make online seat reservations on the [JR East Train Reservation website](https://www.eki-net.com/en/jreast-train-reservation/Top/Index); however, physical seat reservation tickets have to be picked up at a selected ticket office in Hokkaido before use. Note that seat reservations are mandatory on [limited express](e2016.html#category) trains between Sapporo and Noboribetsu.

### Assessment

The pass costs roughly the same as [regular tickets](e2359_001.html) for a round trip by [limited express](e2016.html#category) train between [Sapporo](e2163.html) and [Noboribetsu](e6750.html). So, if you add one or more additional train rides, e.g. a side trip to [Otaru](e6700.html), the pass can provide some savings.
