Ankokuronji (安国論寺) is one of several temples of the [Nichiren sect](e2055.html) of [Japanese Buddhism](e2055.html) along the hills in the southeast of [Kamakura](e2166.html). Nichiren himself founded Ankokuronji around [1253](e2133.html) when he first came to Kamakura, and he is said to have lived at the temple for several years.

Visitors can walk along a short hiking trail through the wooded hills around the temple buildings. A nice view of the city of [Kamakura](e2166.html) can be enjoyed underway. Some of the trail's passages are quite steep and should only be explored with good walking shoes.

Ankokuronji is a 20-25 minute walk southeast from Kamakura Station.
