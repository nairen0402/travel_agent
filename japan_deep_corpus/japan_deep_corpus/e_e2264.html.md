The Tokyo Marathon is [Tokyo](e2164.html)'s large scale city marathon held on the first Sunday of March.

The race starts at the [Metropolitan Government building](e3011_tocho.html) in [Shinjuku](e3011.html) and ends at the [Imperial Palace](e3017.html) not far from [Tokyo Station](e3037.html). The attractively designed route passes several of [Tokyo](e2164.html)'s main tourist spots, including the [Imperial Palace](e3017.html), [Tokyo Tower](e3009.html), [Asakusa](e3004.html) and [Ginza](e3005.html):

The Tokyo Marathon features a marathon race with approximately 35,000 participants and a 10 kilometer race with approximately 500 participants of both genders, including [wheelchair](e2301.html) users, and visually and mentally impaired athletes.

The marathon race is accompanied by various festivities and events, including the Tokyo Marathon Expo in the Tokyo Big Sight complex in [Odaiba](e3008.html).

The application deadline for each marathon is during the preceding summer. Because the number of applicants always exceeds the number of spaces available by a large margin, participants will be determined by lottery, with results announced around early autumn.
