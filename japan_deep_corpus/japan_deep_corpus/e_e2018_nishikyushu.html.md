The Nishikyushu Shinkansen (西九州新幹線, Nishikyūshū Shinkansen or "West Kyushu Shinkansen") is a [shinkansen](e2018.html) line, which runs to [Nagasaki](e2162.html). In the future, the line is expected to connect Nagasaki with [Fukuoka](e2161.html)'s Hakata Station, but it is currently isolated from the rest of the high-speed train network and operates only between [Takeo Onsen](e8385.html) and Nagasaki.

[Limited express](e2016.html) relay trains run between Hakata and Takeo Onsen, providing seamless connections to the shinkansen at Takeo Onsen, where trains line up on opposite tracks of the same platform for easy transfers. It is not clear when and if the remaining section between Takeo Onsen and Hakata will be completed.

The **Kamome** is the only train category along the Nishikyushu Shinkansen, while the limited express trains between Hakata and Takeo Onsen are called "Relay Kamome". The Kamome use 6-car train sets that do not have a Green Car, but reserved seating comes in rows of 2x2 seats which are almost as comfortable as Green Car seats. Non-reserved seating comes in rows of 3x2 seats. Many trains stop at all stations along the line, while others skip one or two stations.

Note: For simplification, some rare train compositions are omitted.
