Inokuma Genichiro (1902-1993) was an artist from [Marugame](e5465.html). Best known for his paintings, Inokuma also produced sculptures and large murals, some of which hang in the Tokyo Imperial Theatre and [Ueno Station](e3019.html). He spent much of his life in Paris and New York painting among contemporaries such as Matisse and Picasso. He was also good friends with Japanese-American sculptor [Isamu Noguchi](e5411.html), who he helped open up a studio in nearby [Takamatsu](e5400.html).

The Mimoca, short for Marugame Genichiro Inokuma Museum of Contemporary Art, was opened in 1991 just next to Marugame Station. The museum's permanent exhibition displays selected works from a collection of over 20,000 of Inokuma's sculptures, paintings and murals. Special exhibitions by both Japanese and international artists are also held in the museum's other halls, while a museum shop and a cafe are also available to visitors.

Mimoca's unique building was designed by accomplished Japanese [architect](e2111_architects.html) Taniguchi Yoshio, who is also responsible for the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Tokyo Sea Life Aquarium in [Kasai Rinkai Park](e3024.html). He also designed the local Higashiyama Kaii Setouchi Art Museum in nearby [Shamijima](e5467.html).

Mimoca is located just a few steps from Marugame Station.
