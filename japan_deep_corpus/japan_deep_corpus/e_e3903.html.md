The main hall (right) and dance stage (left)

Yasaka Shrine (八坂神社, Yasaka Jinja), also known as Gion Shrine, is one of the most famous [shrines](e2059.html) in [Kyoto](e2158.html). Founded over 1350 years ago, the shrine is located between the popular [Gion](e3902.html) and [Higashiyama](e3959.html) districts and is often visited by tourists walking between the two.

The shrine's main hall combines the honden (inner sanctuary) and haiden (offering hall) into a single building. In front of it stands a dance stage with hundreds of lanterns that get lit in the evenings. Each lantern bears the name of a local business in return for a donation.

Yasaka Shrine is well known for its summer festival, the [Gion Matsuri](e3942.html), which is celebrated every July. Arguably the most famous [festival](e2063.html) in the whole country, the Gion Matsuri dates back over a thousand years and involves a procession with massive floats and hundreds of participants. The shrine also becomes busy during the [cherry blossom](e2011.html) season around early April, as the adjacent [Maruyama Park](e3925.html) is one of the most famous [cherry blossom spots in Kyoto](e3951.html).

The main entrance gate at night

Yasaka Shrine can be reached by [bus](e2015.html) from [Kyoto Station](e3922.html) in about 20 minutes. Take number 206 and get off at Gion bus stop. The closest train stations are Gion-Shijo Station on the Keihan Line and Kyoto-Kawaramachi Station on the Hankyu Line.

Alternatively, the 20-30 minute walk from [Kiyomizudera](e3901.html) through the narrow lanes of the [Higashiyama District](e3959.html) to Yasaka Shrine is highly recommended.
