Asama Kannon-do Temple and Mount Asama in the background

The Onioshidashi Park (鬼押出し園, Onioshidashien) features a landscape of volcanic rocks that gives it an unique and rugged appearance. The park is shaped by volcanic sediment deposited here during the 1783 big eruption of Mount Asama. It is located just across the prefectural border in [Gunma Prefecture](/list/e1209.html), but popularly visited in combination with [Karuizawa](e6030.html).

Besides presenting the opportunity to take a closer look at the volcanic rocks of various curious shapes, Onioshidashi Park also offers nice views looking over nearby towns and of Mount Asama on clear days. Located at the center of the park stand a [temple](e2058.html) dedicated to the [Buddhist](e2055.html) Goddess of Mercy Kannon.

Seibu buses operate almost hourly between Karuizawa Station, Naka-Karuizawa Station and the Onioshidashi Park. The one way ride between Karuizawa Station and the park takes 35 minutes and costs 1300 yen.
