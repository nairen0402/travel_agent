The Uchiko History Museum (内子町歴史民俗資料館, Uchikocho Rekishi Minzoku Shiryōkan), also known as the Museum of Commercial and Domestic Life, is located along the main street, outside of the [Yokaichi Old Town](e5552.html) district. The museum is compact, but enjoyable, with life-sized, automated figures recreating the town life of the 19th and 20th centuries.

The displays are visually informative, making up for the lack of English in the written material. On the second floor, beautiful [tatami](e2007.html) rooms with sliding doors and painted screens show how the more stylish town houses of local merchant families looked like.

The Uchiko History Museum a ten minute walk from JR Uchiko Station.
