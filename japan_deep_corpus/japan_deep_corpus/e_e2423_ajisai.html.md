The Hydrangea (紫陽花, アジサイ, ajisai ) is a popular [flower](e2423.html) in Japan. Native hydrangea varieties have been mentioned in Japanese written records from the [8th century](e2132.html), while European varieties were introduced in the early 20th century. Hydrangeas typically bloom during the [rainy season](e2277.html) in June and July, making them a symbol and the most popular flower of the season which generally sees considerably less flowers than the preceding spring season.

There are over 100 varieties of hydrangeas of various colors in Japan today, include those that bloom into balls of flowers and those whose flowers surround a bald patch. Relatively easy to grow, hydrangeas are commonly seen in parks and private gardens. Some [temples](e2058.html) are known for their hydrangea gardens and are popular places to see large numbers of flowers in a picturesque setting. Note that the flowers are often cut prematurely to ensure a good flowering in the following year.
