Within Takamatsu's city center is a long, covered shopping arcade, stretching from [Takamatsu Castle](e5403.html) to [Ritsurin Koen](e5401.html). Made up of various stores, restaurants and two department stores, it is claimed to be the longest covered shopping arcade in Japan with a combined length of nearly 2.7 kilometers.

The northern end of the shopping arcade near Takamatsu Castle and Mitsukoshi Department Store features a large plaza and shopping center with upscale stores like Louis Vuitton and Coach. Lion Dori, a branch street running parallel to the main shopping street, contains mostly restaurants including those serving [Sanuki Udon](e5408.html).

The shopping arcades are a 10-15 minute walk from [Takamatsu Castle](e5403.html) and JR Takamatsu Station. The arcades are also accessible from both Kataharamachi and Kawaramachi stations along the Kotoden Railway Line.
