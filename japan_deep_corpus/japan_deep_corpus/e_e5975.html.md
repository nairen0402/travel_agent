Furukawa (古川) is a small town in the mountains of [Gifu Prefecture](/list/e1220.html) and the center of the rural municipality of Hida City. Furukawa is located only about a 15 minute train ride north of the city of [Takayama](e5900.html). To distinguish it from identically named places elsewhere in Japan, the town is commonly referred to as Hida-Furukawa.

Furukawa is smaller and calmer than Takayama. Like Takayama, the town gained wealth and fame through the high quality timber found in the region and the high level craftsmanship skills of the [local carpenters](e5979.html). Like Takayama, Furukawa has a nicely preserved [old town](e5977.html) and a famous festival. Held one week after the Takayama Spring Festival, the [Furukawa Festival](e5978.html) features large drums, barely dressed men and tall, beautifully decorated floats.
