Take the [Tokaido/Sanyo/Kyushu Shinkansen](e2018.html) from [Tokyo](e2164.html) to [Kumamoto](e4500.html) with one transfer of trains along the way, typically at Shin-Osaka or Hakata Station (6-7 hours, around 27,000 yen). From Kumamoto, take a [bus](e2015.html) to the [Takachiho](e8050.html) Bus Center (3 hours, 2700 yen one way, 1 bus/day). The buses are operated by Kyushu Sanko Bus and Miyazaki Kotsu (Miyakoh) and can be reserved via [Willer](https://willer-travel.com/en/bus_search/kumamoto/kumamoto/miyazaki/takachiho/?utm_source=web&utm_medium=ad&utm_campaign=af01&aid=184).

Above fees and schedules are subject to change. Be sure to check current yen [exchange rates](e2196.html).

[Takachiho](e8050.html) lies in the mountains of northern [Miyazaki Prefecture](/list/e1245.html) along the border with [Kumamoto Prefecture](/list/e1244.html). [Mount Aso](e4552.html) is just across the border and is often combined with a trip to Takachiho.

Most of Takachiho's attractions are scattered in and around the town center and can be accessed on foot by good walkers (the [gorge](e8052.html) is about a 30-40 minute walk from the bus center). The exception is [Amano Iwato Shrine](e8054.html), which stands ten kilometers outside of the town center and is accessible by infrequent [bus](e2015.html) or [taxi](e2021.html).

The [local bus](e2015.html) network is centered at Takachiho Bus Center which is also served by the buses from Nobeoka and the [highway buses](e2366.html) to/from [Kumamoto](e4500.html) and [Fukuoka](e2161.html).

Because public transportation is rather infrequent and inconvenient, [rental cars](e2024.html) are a convenient means to get around town. Rental outlets can be found in nearby Nobeoka City, around [Mount Aso](e4552.html) and at Kumamoto and Miyazaki Airports. Alternatively, electric [bicycles](e2210.html) are available for rent near the Takachiho Bus Center for 500 yen per hour.
