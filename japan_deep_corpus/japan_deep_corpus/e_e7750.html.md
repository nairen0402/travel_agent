The Bandai (磐梯) region in [Fukushima Prefecture](/list/e1208.html) is an attractive outdoor destination, offering various walking and [hiking](e2427.html) opportunities in summer and [skiing](e7753.html) in winter. It centers around [Mount Bandai](e7755.html), a [volcano](e2327.html) which last erupted in 1888. The eruption reshaped the mountain and created the pond-dotted Bandai Highlands, also know as [Urabandai](e7752.html) (literally "behind Bandai").

Further north lie the [Azuma Mountains](e7754.html), a volcanic mountain range with multiple peaks, including the beautifully shaped [Azuma-Kofuji](e7754.html) ("Little Azuma Fuji"), which resembles and is named after the bigger and more famous [Mount Fuji](e2172.html). To the south of Mount Bandai is Lake Inawashiro, one of Japan's biggest lakes.
