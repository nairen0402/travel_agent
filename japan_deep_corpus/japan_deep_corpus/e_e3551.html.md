Nankinmachi (南京町) is a compact [Chinatown](e2420.html) in central Kobe and a center of the Chinese community in the [Kansai Region](/list/e1105.html). The area was developed by Chinese merchants who settled near Kobe Port after the port was opened to foreign trade in [1868](e2130.html). As the Chinatown developed, it became known as Nankinmachi after Nanjing, the former Chinese capital.

Nankinmachi is a popular tourist attraction and shopping and dining district. Two main streets run through the district, meeting each other at a small plaza in the center. They are packed with shops, restaurants and food stands that sell popular items such as steamed buns (manju), ramen, tapioca drinks and various other Chinese dishes, many of which have been Japanized to a certain degree.

Nankinmachi is located a five minutes walk south of Motomachi Station, a ten minute walk southwest of Sannomiya Station or a five minute walk north of [Meriken Park](e3552.html).
