Lake Toya (洞爺湖, Tōyako) is part of the [Shikotsu-Toya National Park](e6735.html). In addition to the lake itself, the Toyako region features [hot springs](e6729.html) and an active volcano, [Mount Usu](e6726.html), which last erupted in the year 2000. The area also offers many fishing, hiking, and camping opportunities.

The picturesque lake was chosen as the location of the G8 summit which Japan hosted in July 2008. The leaders of the world's eight major industrialized democracies met at the [Windsor Hotel Toya Resort & Spa](https://www.booking.com/hotel/jp/the-windsor-toya-resort-spa.html?aid=371183).
