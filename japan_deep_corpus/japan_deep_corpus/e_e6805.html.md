Above fees and schedules are subject to change. Be sure to check current yen [exchange rates](e2196.html).

[Akan Mashu National Park](e6800.html) consists of two distinct sections. The western portion contains [Lake Akan](e6801.html), while the eastern portion contains [Lake Mashu](e6802.html), [Lake Kussharo](e6803.html), [Iozan](e6804.html) (Sulfur Mountain) and the hot spring resort of [Kawayu Onsen](e6806.html).

Because public transportation is infrequent and inconvenient, a [rental car](e2024.html) is recommended for accessing and exploring [Akan Mashu National Park](e6800.html). By car, the park can be reached within 1-2 hours from [Kushiro](e6790.html), [Abashiri](e6865.html) or Bihoro. Car rental outlets are available at the airports, in Kushiro and in Abashiri.

**Akan Bus** runs a few [buses](e2015.html) per day between Kushiro and [Lake Akan](e6801.html) in the park's western portion year round, as well as a few infrequent bus lines around Kawayu, Lake Mashu and Lake Kussharo. Regular bus service between the park's western and eastern portions is not offered. Akan Bus also operates sightseeing bus tours.

Bus service improves slightly during some weeks in winter (January 24 to March 1, 2026) and summer (July 26 to August 31, 2025) when additional, infrequent bus services for tourists are operated around [Lake Mashu](e6802.html) and [Lake Kussharo](e6803.html). During these periods, a 2-day passport is available for the buses for 2000 yen, and a 3-day pass for 3000 yen.

The **JR Senmo Line**, which connects [Kushiro](e6790.html) and [Abashiri](e6865.html), traverses the eastern portion of Akan Mashu National Park, stopping at Kawayu Onsen Station along the way. It takes around two hours to reach Kawayu from either Kushiro or Abashiri by local train, and there are about five [trains](e2019.html) per day.

Two [airports](e2365.html) serve the region: Kushiro Airport is convenient for accessing Lake Akan, while Memanbetsu Airport can be an alternative option for accessing the park's eastern part.

From **Kushiro Airport**, there are direct [buses](e2015.html) to Lake Akan (one hour, 2190 yen one way, 3-5 buses per day). In order to reach Akan's eastern portion, take the airport bus to Kushiro Station (50 minutes, 950 yen) and catch the JR Senmo Line to Kawayu Onsen (100 minutes, 2240 yen, every 2-5 hours).

From **Memanbetsu Airport**, take a bus into [Abashiri](e6865.html) (25 minutes, 1050 yen), from where you can take the JR Senmo Line to Kawayu Onsen (2 hours, 2020 yen, every 2-5 hours). There are also a few sightseeing bus lines from Abashiri and Bihoro into [Akan Mashu National Park](e6800.html).
