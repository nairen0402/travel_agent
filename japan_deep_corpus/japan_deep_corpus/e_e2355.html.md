Ferry arriving on Rishiri Island

Consisting of several thousand islands, Japan is naturally home to an extensive network of ferry routes. Japan's four main islands (Honshu, [Hokkaido](/list/e1101.html), [Kyushu](/list/e1108.html) and [Shikoku](/list/e1107.html)) are connected with each other by bridges and tunnels, but many smaller islands can only be reached by ship. Yet even between the main islands, ferries can be an interesting, if not particularly fast alternative to [trains](e2019.html), [buses](e2366.html) and [planes](e2365.html).

Most ferries transport people, vehicles and cargo. While shorter routes are served by small ships, able to carry a couple of cars and a few dozens of passengers, large liners are employed on longer routes. Large ferries can carry hundreds of vehicles and passengers and are usually equipped with a range of amenities such as [public baths](e2074.html) and a [restaurant](e2036.html).

Lounge and restaurant on board of a larger ferry

On most long-distance ferries, passengers have the choice between three classes: 2nd class, 1st class and special class (availability and namings vary on the company and ferry):

* **2nd class without bed**
    
  *the cheapest option*
    
  Common space with a carpet or [tatami mats](e2007.html) to rest on.

* **2nd class with bed**
    
  *typically 20%-40% more expensive than 2nd class w/o bed*
    
  Dormitory or semi-private spaces with beds.

* **1st class**
    
  *typically twice the cost of 2nd class w/o bed*
    
  Private room with beds.

* **Special class**
    
  *typically 2.5 to three times the cost of 2nd class w/o bed*
    
  More luxurious private room with beds.

Semi-private compartments on board of an overnight ferry

The cost for taking a [car](e2024.html) onto a ferry usually depends on the length of the car and includes the fare for the driver but not for additional passengers. Advance reservations are possible and recommended on some routes, but are not needed on routes with relatively frequent departures.

Bicycles can also be taken onto most ferries. As a rule of thumb, the cost for bringing a bicycle is about 100 [yen](e2196.html) for each hour of travel. So, on a 9 hour trip, for example, a bicycle will cost around 900 yen.

Cars being loaded onto a ferry

Ferry tickets can be purchased through the ferry companies directly (by phone, online or at the ferry terminal) or through travel agencies. The availability of English speaking staff cannot be counted on. Some ferry routes can be reserved online in English through [Direct Ferries](https://www.directferries.com/?dfpid=2097&affid=100&rurl=) and [Willer Travel](https://willer-travel.com/en/ferry/?utm_source=web&utm_medium=ad&utm_campaign=af01&aid=184).
