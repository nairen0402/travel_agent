Jionzenji Temple (慈恩禅寺) was founded in the 16th century as the family [temple](e2058.html) of the local feudal lord, and contains the mausoleums of four former lords. A Zen monastery was added to the mausoleums and main temple hall, but it was destroyed in a flood and never rebuilt.

Jionzenji stands out among [Gujo](e5930.html)'s temples because of its beautiful Zen [garden](e2099.html). A priest designed the garden to feature a pond, waterfall and many maple trees. Though it is classified as a "strolling pond garden", the garden itself cannot actually be entered by visitors, but can only be viewed from inside the temple building.

Jionzenji's buildings and [garden](e2099.html) were rebuilt in their entirety after a landslide destroyed the property in the 1950s. Pictures of the landslide and its destructive effects on Jionzenji hang in the main temple hall to commemorate the event.

Jionzenji Temple is located in the southeastern area of central [Gujo](e5930.html), about a ten minute walk south of the tourist information office.
