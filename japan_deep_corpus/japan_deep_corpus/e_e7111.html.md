The Ocean Expo Park's Fountain Plaza seen from the Central Gate

The Ocean Expo Park (海洋博公園, Kaiyōhakukōen) is a large park on the tip of the Motobu Peninsula in northern [Okinawa Honto](e7101.html), which was built in 1976 to commemorate the Okinawa International Ocean Expo held there a year earlier. The park's main attraction is the [Churaumi Aquarium](e7109.html), Japan's best [aquarium](e2425.html).

The park stretches about three kilometers along the coast and is so extensive that small buses run on several routes around the grounds for 300 yen per ride or 500 yen for a 1-day pass. The various sites and facilities are also connected by attractive walking paths.

A house in the Native Okinawan Village

Apart from [Churaumi Aquarium](e7109.html), there are a number of other interesting facilities in the park:

The spacious **Oceanic Culture Museum**, located just beside the park's central gate, exhibits ship replicas and other informative displays about ocean-based cultures from Asia and the South Pacific, including a giant replica of a Lakatoi canoe from Papua New Guinea and a trade ship used for travel by the [Ryukyu Kingdom](e7125.html). The museum also includes a planetarium.

Just next to the museum stands the **Native Okinawan Village**, a small [open air museum](e2421.html) with over 20 residences and other buildings from different time periods and regions of [Okinawa](/list/e1247.html). There is no admission fee and no staff, and visitors are free to wander around.

The view from the Tropical Dream Center's observatory tower

A variety of tropical plants can be seen across the Ocean Expo Park along the walking trails and in two arboretums. Furthermore, there is the **Tropical Dream Center**, a well maintained botanical garden with a wide range of tropical trees and plants in multiple greenhouses. The center also features a 36 meter tall observatory tower that resembles the Tower of Babel.

At the northern end of the Ocean Expo Park lies **Emerald Beach**, an attractive [sand beach](e2461.html). [Emerald Beach](e7119.html#emeraldbeach) is divided into three separate areas that each face into a different direction: a beach for playing and swimming, a beach for resting and a beach for viewing.

The Ocean Expo Park is located on the Motobu Peninsula in northern [Okinawa Honto](e7101.html), about 90 kilometers from [Naha](e7102.html).

### By direct bus from Naha

The Okinawa Airport Shuttle, the Yanbaru Express and bus line 117 directly connect the airport and city center of [Naha](e7102.html) with the Ocean Expo Park. The one way trip takes a little over two hours and costs 1900-2000 yen on the Okinawa Airport Shuttle and the Yanbaru Express and 2770-2880 yen on bus 117. There are 1-2 [buses](e2015.html) per hour. In central Naha, the Airport Shuttle and Yanbaru Express stop at the Prefectural Office (県庁北口, Kenchō Kitaguchi) while bus 117 stops at the Naha Bus Terminal. Discounted round trip tickets are available through [Klook](https://www.klook.com/activity/59046-churaumi-aquarium-highway-bus-pass/?aid=12675).

### By bus from Nago

Most [buses](e2015.html) along the lines 65 and 66 connect Nago with the Kinen Kōen-mae (記念公園前) bus stop in front of the [Ocean Expo Park](e7111.html) (50 minutes, 900 yen one way, hourly). Note that a few buses run on a slightly different route that does not serve the expo park.

### By car

By [car](e2024.html), take the [Okinawa Expressway](e2354.html) from Naha all the way to its northern end near Nago (1040 yen one way) and then follow regular roads across the Motobu Peninsula to the Ocean Expo Park. In total, the journey takes about two hours one way (more during rush hours).
