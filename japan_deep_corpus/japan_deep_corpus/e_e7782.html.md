Rokkakudo Hall

Rokkakudo (六角堂, Rokkakudō, lit. "hexagonal hall") is a small building located on the Pacific coast in northern [Ibaraki Prefecture](/list/e1211.html), close to the city of [Iwaki](e7775.html) across the prefectural border in [Fukushima](/list/e1208.html). The uniquely shaped building was constructed in 1905 by the influential scholar and artist Okakura Tenshin as a refuge for artistic activities after he relocated to the area in 1903. It was swept away by the [2011 tsunami](/news/0018.html), but was rebuilt in 2012 in its original style.

Okakura Tenshin (aka Okakura Kakuzo) is best known in the English world for his 1906 publication "The Book of Tea" in which he introduces [tea](e2096.html) and the Japanese culture to a Western audience. Besides the Rokkakudo Hall, visitors can also view a small memorial museum devoted to Okakura as well as his former residence, a beautiful Japanese-style building; however, the residence cannot be entered. Next to the residence stands a stone monument called "Asia is One".
