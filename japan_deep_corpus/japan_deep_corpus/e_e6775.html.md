Daisetsuzan (大雪山) is [Hokkaido](/list/e1101.html)'s largest [national park](e2325.html). It preserves a mountainous area of virtually unspoiled wilderness, which is larger than some of Japan's smaller [prefectures](/list/e1002.html). It is a paradise for [hikers](e2427_where.html), outdoor lovers, deer and brown bears, and the first place in Japan to see [fall colors](e2014.html) and [snow](e2265.html) each autumn.
