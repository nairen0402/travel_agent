### Points of sale

The actual pass has to be picked up at a major station in the area covered before use, including Tottori, Matsue, Yonago or Sakaiminato stations, or at [Kansai Airport](e2033.html), Osaka or Shin-Osaka stations. An advantage of purchasing the pass through the official website is that you can make [seat reservations](#seat) online, while others can make seat reservations only at ticket machines and offices.

### Seat reservations

Seat reservations can be made at no additional cost at ticket offices. The first six reservations can alternatively be made at ticket machines, but subsequent reservations can be made only at ticket offices. Furthermore, those who purchased their pass through the [official JR West website](https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/) can also use the JR West website to make seat reservations, but the website is not very easy to use.

### Assessment

The Tottori Matsue Pass can be a good value for those exploring [Tottori](e8100.html), [Matsue](e5800.html) and [Izumo](e5830.html) by train. For example, it costs about the same as a regular one way ticket for a [limited express](e2016.html#category) train ride between Tottori and Matsue.
