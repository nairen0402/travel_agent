Eating wanko soba

Morioka is well known for its various styles of noodles, which - encompassing Japanese, Korean and Chinese cuisines - have been adapted to suit local taste buds. The "Three Great Noodles of Morioka" are Wanko Soba, Reimen and Jajamen, and they can be enjoyed at specialized [restaurants](e2036.html) and general establishments offering local dishes.

  Wanko Soba

  Eating Wanko Soba is an experience in itself. Each serving contains roughly a mouthful of [soba noodles](e2341.html), and the server will constantly keep topping up your empty bowl with more noodles until you indicate that you have had enough. The first bowl is eaten plain to taste the flavor, and toppings can be added from the second bowl. The average for women is about 30-40 bowls, while men average about 50-60 bowls.

  Reimen

  Morioka Reimen, as it is more popularly known outside of Morioka, was originally a Korean noodle dish. It is said to be the creation of a North Korean resident of Morioka who wanted to recreate the cold noodles he had as a child. The noodles are made of potato starch and flour, giving it a slightly glassy sheen. The broth is chilled and the dish has toppings like sliced meat, kimchi, a slice of fruit (usually pear, apple or watermelon), half a hard boiled egg, and cucumbers.

  Jajamen

  Jajamen has its origins in Chinese Zhajiangmian, but has since evolved to suit the locals' taste buds. Jajamen noodles, a variant of [udon](/r/e105.html), are served dry with a scoop of meat [miso](e2045.html), a handful of sliced green onions and sliced cucumbers, with ginger on the side. Mix the miso and noodles evenly before adding vinegar, chili oil or garlic to taste. After finishing the noodles, it is common to crack a raw egg into your plate and ask for "chitantan" - an egg soup made with the remaining meat miso on the plate, raw egg and hot water. Jajamen is not expensive and can be found at specialized [restaurants](e2036.html).
