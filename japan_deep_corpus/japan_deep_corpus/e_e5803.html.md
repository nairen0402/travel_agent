Lafcadio Hearn, one of the first Western authors of Japanese culture, lived in [Matsue](e5800.html) for about one year of his life. Hearn's former residence is now open to the public along with a museum located next door that is dedicated to his work and person.

Lafcadio Hearn was born in Greece in 1850 to an Irish father and a Greek mother. He resided in Greece, Ireland, Britain, France and the USA before emigrating to Japan in 1890. There he held various teaching positions, married a Japanese lady and was naturalized as Koizumi Yakumo, the name he remains known under in Japan. He passed away in Tokyo in 1904.

Hearn is best known for his books that introduced Japan to the Western world such as "Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan" and a collection of translated legends "Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things".
