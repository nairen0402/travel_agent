Matsumoto (松本) is the second largest city in [Nagano Prefecture](/list/e1216.html). It is most famous for [Matsumotojo](e6051.html), one of Japan's most beautiful original [castles](e2296.html). The city is also a good base for trips into the [Japanese Alps](e6043.html), e.g. to [Kamikochi](e6040.html), [Norikura](e6045.html) or the [Tateyama-Kurobe Alpine Route](e7550.html).
