Oshima (雄島) is a small, pine tree-covered island close to the pier of [Matsushima](e5100.html). The island can be accessed over a short bridge free of charge and offers some pleasant, short walks. There are multiple small [shrines](e2059.html) and viewpoints dotted about the island.

Oshima used to be a retreat for monks, and decorated meditation caves can still be found on the island. The bridge to Oshima was destroyed in the [2011 tsunami](e5027.html), but was rebuilt and reopened two years later.

Oshima is a 5-10 minute walk from Matsushima-Kaigan Station or a 15 minute walk from Matsushima Pier.
