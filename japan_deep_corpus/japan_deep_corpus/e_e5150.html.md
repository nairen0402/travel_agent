With roughly one million inhabitants, Sendai (仙台) is by far the largest city in the [Tohoku Region](/list/e1102.html) and one of the country's 15 largest [cities](/list/e1003.html). The modern city of Sendai was founded around 1600 by Date Masamune, one of [feudal Japan](e2128.html)'s most powerful lords. Many of Sendai's tourist attractions are related to Masamune and his family.

Less than an hour northeast of the city center lies the town of [Matsushima](e5100.html), whose bay is dotted by pine-clad islets and is known for one of Japan's [three most scenic views](e2250.html).
