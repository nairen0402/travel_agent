Matsue Castle (松江城, Matsuejō) is one of only a dozen original [castles](e2296.html) in Japan, meaning that its main tower has survived to this day through fires, [earthquakes](e2116.html) and the anti-feudal demolitions of the [Meiji Period](e2130.html). It is known for its bulky, dark and austere exterior.

Matsue Castle was completed in 1611, a few years after the last decisive battle of [feudal Japan](e2128.html). In 1638, the fief and castle were reassigned to a branch of the Matsudaira clan, relatives of the ruling [Tokugawa](e2128.html). Perched atop a hill and surrounded by a moat and thick walls, the castle was built to withstand a war, though, thanks to the timing of its construction, it never actually saw a battle. Major renovation works were undertaken in the 1950s to further preserve it, and the interior of the main keep now houses a museum displaying period arms and artifacts.

In addition to touring the castle's main keep and grounds, visitors can also enjoy a river boat cruise around the castle moat. The boats, which depart every 20-30 minutes from a handful of departure points around the castle, are driven around the moat and narrow canals that form the Horikawa River by boatmen and boatwomen who share about the history of the area (in Japanese only, although audio recordings in other languages are also available).

Matsue Castle can be reached in a 30 minute walk from JR Matsue Station or in a 15 minute walk from Ichibata Dentetsu's Matsue-Shinjiko-Onsen Station. The castle is also connected with both train stations by the [Lakeline](e5805.html) loop bus.
