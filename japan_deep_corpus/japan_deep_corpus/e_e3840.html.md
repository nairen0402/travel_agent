Nasu-Shiobara (那須塩原) is the area around [Mount Nasudake](e3842.html), an active volcano in the northernmost corner of [Tochigi Prefecture](/list/e1210.html). Part of Nikko National Park, Nasu-Shiobara's forested highlands are home to several [hot springs](e2292.html) including [Nasu Onsen](e3842.html) on the volcano's slopes and [Shiobara Onsen](e3843.html), a town in a forested valley southwest of the mountain.

Besides hot springs, Nasu-Shiobara is known for its natural scenery. Mount Nasudake is a popular hiking destination, and there are various other forested hiking trails that lead to waterfalls and pedestrian suspension bridges along the mountain's lower slopes.
