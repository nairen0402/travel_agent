Joeiji (常栄寺, Jōeiji) is a Zen [temple](e2058.html) famous for its [garden](e2099.html), Sesshutei. As its name suggests, the garden was built by the well-known monk, painter and garden designer Sesshu. It is a live representation of one of Sesshu's landscape paintings. Completed about 500 years ago, Sesshutei utilizes many vertically upright rocks, a style of rock arrangement distinct of the [Muromachi Period](e2134.html) (1333 - 1573).

Visitors can view Sesshutei from the main temple building and are welcome to explore the building's spacious [tatami rooms](e2007.html). They can then spend some tranquil moments strolling along the circular path that leads around the scenic garden. The precincts of Joeiji encloses several other beautiful temple buildings, as well as a couple of raked pebble [Zen](e2055.html) gardens.
