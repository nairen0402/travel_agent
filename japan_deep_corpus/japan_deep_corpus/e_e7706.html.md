Oyakuen (御薬園) is a pleasant Japanese [landscape garden](e2099.html) with a pond where visitors to [Aizu](e7700.html) can go for a quiet stroll. Oyakuen can be translated as "Medicinal Herb Garden", a name given in the 18th century when the feudal lord encouraged citizens to cultivate medicinal plants. So, besides its pond garden, Oyakuen has a herb garden where hundreds of types of medicinal plants are still grown.

Oyakuen's main garden consists of carefully cultivated greenery centered around a pond. A path winds around the pond, and walking along it is the best way to enjoy the garden. There are a few buildings at Oyakuen which may be of interest to travelers: a tea house, a souvenir shop and a dining room.

Herb Garden

The [Aizu Loop Bus](e7701.html) stops at "Oyakuen" bus stop (30 minutes from Aizu-Wakamatsu Station) just outside the garden's entrance gate.
