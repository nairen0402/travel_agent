The Date Museum (伊達博物館, Date Hakubutsukan) commemorates the Date Clan, who ruled over [Uwajima](e5575.html) for more than 250 years during the [Edo Period](e2128.html) (1603-1868). The first lord of Uwajima was Date Hidemune, who hailed from the main branch of the Date family based in [Sendai](e5150.html). Uwajima grew and prospered under the rule of generations of lords from the Date Clan.

The [museum](e2428.html) exhibits many artifacts and belongings of the Date family, such as weapons, scroll paintings, family crests, writings and daily-used items. It showcases a sizable collection of beautiful folding screens (byobu) that bear precious paintings. Maps depicting Uwajima in the past enable visitors to see how the castle town has been reshaped over the years. In particular, the waterfront west of the city has changed quite dramatically as a result of land reclamation.

Located close to [Tenshaen Garden](e5579.html), the Date Museum can be reached in a 20-30 minute walk from Uwajima Station. Alternatively, Uwajima Bus operates hourly [buses](e2015.html) between the station and Tenshaen-mae bus stop (天赦園前, 10 minutes, 160 yen one way), which is situated a few steps from the museum.
