Covered by: [Japan Rail Pass](/e/e2361.html)

[Tokyo](e2164.html) and [Fukuoka](e2161.html) (Hakata Station) are connected with each other by the [Tokaido](e2018_tokaido.html)/[Sanyo Shinkansen](e2018_sanyo.html). The one way trip by direct [Nozomi](e2018_tokaido.html) trains takes five hours and costs around 23,000 yen. The [Japan Rail Pass](e2361.html) fully covers [Hikari](e2018_tokaido.html) and [Sakura](e2018_sanyo.html) trains, but a supplement fee of 8,140 yen is required if using a Nozomi train. The trip by Hikari and Sakura trains adds about one hour to the total travel time and requires a transfer of trains at Shin-Osaka Station.

Tokyo-Fukuoka is one of the world's busiest air routes with dozens of departures per day, operated by JAL, ANA, Starflyer, Skymark, Peach and Jetstar Japan. Flight duration is about 110 minutes. Most flights use Tokyo's [Haneda Airport](e2430.html), but a few flights also use [Narita Airport](e2027.html). [Fukuoka Airport](e2436.html) is Japan's most easily accessible [airport](e2365.html), only a five minute subway ride from the city's main railway station, Hakata Station.

The regular one way fare by JAL, ANA and Starflyer is around 45,000 yen, but [discount fares](e2364.html) are typically available for 16,000 to 35,000 yen. The cheapest options are Skymark, Peach and Jetstar Japan with one way fares of around 5,000 to 25,000 yen.

Ocean Tokyu Ferry operates daily [ferries](e2355.html) between Tokyo (Tokyo Ferry Terminal on [Odaiba](e3008.html)) and [Kitakyushu](e4875.html) (Shin-Moji Port). The one way journey takes 34 hours and costs around 21,000 yen in the cheapest class. From Shin-Moji Port, there is a shuttle taxi to Moji Station (440 yen one way) from where Fukuoka can be reached in about 90 minutes and 1,500 yen by local trains or 35 minutes and 2,350 yen by local train and [shinkansen](e2018.html) via Kokura (unreserved seat; the cost for a reserved seat is over 1,000 yen more expensive). Please visit our [ferry page](e2355.html) for more details.

Above fees and schedules are subject to change. Be sure to check current yen [exchange rates](e2196.html).

[Fukuoka](e2161.html) is served by Japan Railways (JR), Nishitetsu Railways, three subway lines and a [bus](e2015.html) network. The city's main station is **Hakata Station** with direct connections to Honshu and across [Kyushu](/list/e1108.html), including [Nagasaki](e2162.html), [Kumamoto](e4500.html) and [Kagoshima](e4600.html).

The local railway company **Nishitetsu** is useful for visiting [Dazaifu](e4850.html). Nishitetsu trains depart from Tenjin Station (also known as Nishitetsu Fukuoka Station) in the central entertainment and shopping district of Tenjin. Most [city buses](e2015.html) in Fukuoka are also operated by Nishitetsu.

The **subway** connects Hakata Station, Tenjin Station and Fukuoka Airport with each other and provides access to many of the city's tourist attractions. [Fukuoka Airport](e2436.html) is one of Japan's most centrally located airports, only a five minute subway ride from Hakata Station.

* **Prepaid cards**
    
  Prepaid cards provide no savings over regular tickets, but can be more convenient to use. There are three prepaid cards in Fukuoka: Sugoca (by JR Kyushu), Nimoca (by Nishitetsu Railways) and Hayakaken (by Fukuoka Subways), but all of them can be used on all trains, subways and buses in the greater Fukuoka region. [Seven other IC cards](e2359_003.html) from other major cities of Japan, including Suica, can also be used. The cards can be purchased through ticket machines at all railway and subway stations.
* **1-Day Subway Pass** (640 yen)
    
  Unlimited use of Fukuoka's subway lines on one calendar day. The ticket costs 640 yen and is sold through vending machines at all subway stations.
* **Fukuoka Tourist City Pass** (2500 or 2800 yen)
    
  This pass for exclusive use by foreign tourists is valid on one calendar day on virtually all trains and buses in Fukuoka, including the subway, JR and Nishitetsu. In addition, it provides discounted admission to some tourist sights. Since its massive price increase, the pass is very difficult to pay off, and most people will travel more cheaply by paying regular fares with an [IC card](e2359_003.html). A 2500 yen version of the pass is valid only within Fukuoka City, while a 2800 yen version also includes the Nishitetsu train to nearby [Dazaifu](e4850.html). Sales locations include the tourist information desks at Hakata Station and [Fukuoka Airport](e2436.html), and the ticket offices of the Hakata and Tenjin subway stations and bus terminals.
* **Fukuoka Wide Pass** (3500 yen)
    
  The [Fukuoka Wide Pass](e2361_fukuoka.html) is a digital ticket valid on two consecutive days on JR trains around [Fukuoka Prefecture](/list/e1242.html) and as far as [Shimonoseki](e6140.html) and [Karatsu](e8375.html) across the prefectural borders. It does not cover [shinkansen](e2018.html) trains or the subways in Fukuoka. The pass is not convenient for getting around the city, but it can pay off for travelers making side trips out of the city.
