Sanuki Udon (讃岐うどん) are [udon noodles](/r/e105.html) from [Kagawa Prefecture](/list/e1233.html). They are named after the prefecture's former name, Sanuki. Along with [Gunma](/list/e1209.html)'s [Mizusawa Udon](e7479.html) and [Akita](/list/e1203.html)'s Inaniwa Udon, Sanuki Udon is ranked among Japan's three most famous udon noodles. But better known than Mizusawa and Inaniwa udon, Sanuki Udon has become popular nationwide.

Sanuki Udon is characterized by its firm, chewy texture, achieved by using a specific type of wheat, which has been traditionally grown in [Kagawa Prefecture](/list/e1233.html). These days, the wheat to make Sanuki Udon is primarily imported from Australia.

Like other udon noodles, Sanuki Udon can be served in many different ways, including cold with a dipping sauce or in a hot broth with toppings. Sanuki Udon is considered a cheap, fast and healthy food, with basic dishes costing only a few hundred yen.

Udon remains extremely popular in Kagawa Prefecture, which even promotes itself as the "udon prefecture". With over 700 Sanuki Udon restaurants across the prefecture, a fair number can be found in the shopping and dining districts of [Takamatsu](e5400.html).
