Matsuyama (松山) is the largest city on [Shikoku](/list/e1107.html) and the capital of [Ehime Prefecture](/list/e1235.html). At the heart of the city stands [Matsuyamajo](e5501.html), a beautiful, original [castle](e2296.html). The castle's hilltop vantage point offers a view of the city and a glimpse of the [Seto Inland Sea](e5445.html).

The city is also famed for being the setting of [Natsume Soseki](e5505.html)'s popular novel, entitled "Botchan". Often read as part of the Japanese school curriculum, the novel describes Matsuyama during the turbulent [Meiji Restoration](e2130.html). Natsume's novel helped make the city renowned throughout Japan.

[Dogo Onsen](e5502.html) is frequently mentioned in "Botchan" and is one of Matsuyama's main tourist attractions. Located on the northeastern outskirts of the city, Dogo Onsen is one of Japan's oldest [hot spring](e2292.html) resorts.
