The Nirayama Reverberatory Furnace (韮山反射炉, Nirayama Hansharo) is a well preserved iron smelting facility on the [Izu Peninsula](e6310.html). Built by the [Tokugawa government](e2128.html) in 1857, the furnace represents the start of modern iron production in Japan. The Nirayama Furnace is the most complete reverberatory furnaces still standing, and the site received [world heritage status](e2251.html) in summer 2015 among the [Sites of Japan's Meiji Industrial Revolution](e2252.html).

Originally part of a larger factory complex, the furnace was constructed of local stones and bricks. It represented the most advanced technology of the time, and iron produced there was processed on site and cast into cannons, which were desperately needed to shore up the country's coastal defenses in response to the arrival of Commodore Perry and his [black ships](e6301.html). Visitors can approach the furnace bodies and four, 15.7 meter high chimneys, which stand encased in protective steel frames. There is also a small museum with more explanations about the site and a few cannons on display.

The Nirayama Reverberatory Furnace is located a 30 minute walk from Izu-Nagaoka Station on the Izuhakone Railway Line (20 minutes, 360 yen from Mishima Station or 15 minutes, 310 yen from Shuzenji Station; multiple departures per hour). Alternatively, the furnace is a 10 minute, 1000 yen [taxi](e2021.html) ride from the station.
