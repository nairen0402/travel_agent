Check-out time for [ryokan](e2029.html) is usually 10:00 or 11:00. This leaves just enough time to have a morning [bath](e2292.html) and to linger over [breakfast](e2029_breakfast.html). A staff member might come into your room while you are away eating breakfast to put away the [futon](e2007.html). If not, just leave your futon laid out on the floor, although you should try to leave the rest of the room tidy.

Check-out normally happens at the reception desk or in the lobby. You may be offered [tea](e2041.html) again, just as you were when you arrived. While most ryokan now accept major [credit cards](e2196.html), smaller establishments may not. When your bill is settled and you are ready to depart, the staff, including the maid who tended to your [room](e2029_guestrooms.html) and meals, will be on hand to help you into your shoes and wave and bow goodbye.
