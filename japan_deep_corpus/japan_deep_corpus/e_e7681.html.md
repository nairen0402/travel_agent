The Sado History Museum (Sado Rekishi Densetsukan) exhibits the cultural history of [Sado Island](e7675.html), using intriguing displays with animatronic puppets that reenact historical events and local legends. Information in English, however, is sparse.

Many displays center around Sado's history as a place of exile and introduce three of the island's most prominent, involuntary visitors: the former Emperor Juntoku, the [Buddhist](e2055.html) monk Nichiren and Zeami, the founder of [Noh](e2091.html). Other exhibits depict some of [Sado](e7675.html)'s local legends, while a separate corner of the museum is dedicated to the late local artist Sasaki Shodo, who was designated a Living National Treasure for his invaluable skills as a metal casting artist.

### By car

The Sado History Museum is located just outside of Mano-Shinmachi Town. From Ryotsu Port, the museum can be reached in about 30 minutes by [car](e2024.html).
