### Ticket types

Since the coronavirus pandemic, regular park visitors must purchase tickets online in advance for a specific date, and an upper admission limit of visitors is maintained, i.e. it is possible for tickets to sell out on a given date. Same-day tickets are available only to guests staying at [Disney hotels and "official hotels"](e3016_hotels.html) who can purchase tickets for any day during their stay regardless of the daily admission limit.

The cost of tickets depends on the date of visit and is higher on popular days, such as weekends, [national holidays](e2062.html) and during vacation periods:

* **1-Day Passport**
    
  Adult (18 and over): 7,900-10,900 yen  
  Junior (ages 12-17): 6,600-9,000 yen  
  Child (ages 4-11): 4,700-5,600 yen
    
  Good for entry to either [Tokyo Disneyland](e3016_land.html) or [Tokyo DisneySea](e3016_sea.html) on one calendar day. The date and park are fixed at the time of purchase.
* **Early Evening Passport (from 3pm)**
    
  Adult (18 and over): 6,500-8,700 yen  
  Junior (ages 12-17): 5,300-7,200 yen  
  Child (ages 4-11): 3,800-4,400 yen
    
  Good for entry to either park on weekends and [national holidays](e2062.html) after 3pm.
* **Weeknight Passport (from 5pm)**
    
  All ages: 4,500-6,200 yen
    
  Good for entry to either park on weekdays after 5pm.

### How to purchase tickets

Tickets can be purchased through the resort's [official website](https://reserve.tokyodisneyresort.jp/en/) and various travel reservation websites, such as [Klook](https://www.klook.com/activity/695-tokyo-disney-resort-1-day-pass-tokyo/?aid=12675). Only guests staying at [Disney hotels and "official hotels"](e3016_hotels.html) have the privilege to purchase tickets at their hotels for any dates during their stay and regardless of the daily admission limit.

### When to go

Tokyo Disney Resort is enjoyable around the year, especially during the spring and autumn when the [temperatures](e2273.html) are most pleasant. Winter generally (but not always) comes with somewhat smaller crowds, while summer brings rather high temperatures and humidity. As a rule of thumb, the parks usually get particularly busy during the following periods:

* Weekends (especially long weekends)
* [National holidays](e2062.html)
* School holidays:
  + Spring holidays (mid March to early April)
  + Summer holidays (late July through August)
  + Winter holidays (late December to early January)

### Reserving attractions

The Tokyo Disney Resort App ([Google](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.tokyodisneyresort.portalapp&hl=en&gl=US)/[Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tokyo-disney-resort-app/id1313147771)) allows visitors to make reservations for selected rides, restaurants, shops and parades in order to skip the lines or reduce waiting times. There are two methods: free **Standby Passes** and paid **Disney Premier Access**, the latter of which typically costs 1500-2500 yen per reservation.

The two systems work in a similar fashion (apart from the fact that one is paid and the other is not): every ticket holder can make one reservation upon entering the park, and further reservations can be obtained after the previous one was used up or after a certain time period has elapsed (typically 60-120 minutes), whichever occurs earlier.
