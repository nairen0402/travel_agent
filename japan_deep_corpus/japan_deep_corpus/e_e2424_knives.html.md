Master blacksmith hammering metal to give it a knife shape

Blades have been a part of Japanese culture for ages, most famously in the form of the sword (刀, katana). The techniques for forging blades have been refined over time, and Japanese blades have been considered among the best in the world for many centuries.

Today, the production, purchase and ownership of swords is strictly regulated, and new swords are hard to come by. With the days of the [samurai](e2127.html) long gone, the humble kitchen knife (包丁, hōchō) has replaced the sword, attracting the attention of cooks worldwide.

### Where to see knives and swords

Besides a few specialized sword museums, most [history museums](e2428.html) and [castles](e2296.html) have one or more swords on display. Below is a short list of spots that may be of interest to tourists interested in knives and swords:

  Sasuke Smith

  Sasuke is a family-run blacksmith forge in Sakai City, just south of [Osaka](e2157.html). Specializing in garden shears and kitchen knives, their exquisite products have been exhibited at the Louvre in Paris. Tours are available with advance reservations, and there is a hands-on session at the end of the tour to use the knives and scissors.

### Where to buy knives

Many former sword makers are now producing knives and scissors. Regions famous for knife production include Seki City in [Gifu Prefecture](/list/e1220.html), Sakai City directly south of [Osaka](e2157.html) and Sanjo City in [Niigata Prefecture](/list/e1207.html).

Renowned knife brands can be found at major [department stores](e2072.html) or at the makers' individual shops across the country. Visiting a knife shop can be quite overwhelming for the average home cook as there is a huge variety of knives for all different purposes. [Kappabashi Street](e3020.html) and the [Tsukiji outer market](e3021.html) are a couple of places in [Tokyo](e2164.html) with a lot of knife shops.

### Knife-related activities

There are a variety of unique [experiences](e2424.html) for those who want to go a step deeper learning about Japanese knives. A **forge tour** provides a closer look at the process of knife making, but note that only a few forges offer tours and even fewer do so in English. Alternatively, there are some museums where demonstrations are offered. The [Takefu Knife Village](#takefu) near [Fukui](e6600.html), Hocho Kobo Tadafusa in Tsubame-Sanjo, [Niigata](/list/e1207.html), the Sakai Hamono Museum and the [Sasuke Smith](#sasuke) in Sakai, south of [Osaka](e2157.html), are some places to consider.

In addition to forge tours, **hands-on activities** are offered at some forges or in popular blacksmith regions, such as knife sharpening, making a small letter opener or making your own knife, including hammering and sharpening. Simpler workshops take 1-2 hours and are available from 1000 yen, while the making of an entire knife will take 3-6 hours and cost at least 5000 yen. Advance reservations are typically required for these experiences. Online reservation site, such as [Klook](https://www.klook.com/search/result/?query=knife%20japan&aid=12675) and [Rakuten](https://experiences.travel.rakuten.com/experiences/20109?scid=af_txp_japan-guide), also list a few knife-related activities.
