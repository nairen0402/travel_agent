[Tomioka](e7115.html) is located about 100 kilometers northwest of [Tokyo](e2164.html) and is best accessed by train:

Take the [JR Joetsu Shinkansen](e2018_joetsu.html) (50-60 minutes, around 5000 yen one way) or a local train along the JR Takasaki Line (about 110 minutes, around 1980 yen one way) from [Tokyo](e2164.html) to Takasaki. At Takasaki, transfer to the Joshin Railway to Joshu-Tomioka (35 minutes, 810 yen one way). A special round trip ticket is available for 2200 yen that includes admission to the [Tomioka Silk Mill](e7417.html) in addition to the train rides between Takasaki and Joshu-Tomioka. The [JR Tokyo Wide Pass](e2361_06.html) covers the entire trip from Tokyo to [Tomioka](e7415.html), but other JR passes are not valid on the Joshin Railway.

Above fees and schedules are subject to change. Be sure to check current yen [exchange rates](e2196.html).

The [Tomioka Silk Mill](e7417.html) is relatively easily reached by public transportation, but the other three related sites are not, as they are distributed over a wide area, and access by public transportation is infrequent at best. Consequently, a [rental car](e2024.html) is recommended to those who intend to visit the other related sites. There are a number of rental car outlets available around JR Takasaki Station and one outlet near Joshu-Tomioka Station.
