The Miyajima Museum of History and Folklore (宮島歴史民俗資料館, Miyajima Rekishi Minzoku Shiryōkan) aims to illustrate to visitors the history of [Miyajima](e3401.html), both in its larger historical context and in the commonplace details of Miyajima residents' daily lives. Works of art and artifacts relating to the island's [shrine](e3450.html) and its ceremonies are put on display alongside common tools used by local inhabitants in their day to day lives.

The museum building itself is also of interest. Built about 160 years ago, it originally served as the residence and storehouse of a wealthy merchant family who prospered in the [soya sauce](e2045.html) business. The front half of the museum consists of the preserved living quarters of the family, which look out onto a traditional [Japanese garden](e2099.html) in the courtyard.

The Miyajima Museum of History and Folklore is a short walk from the exit of [Itsukushima Shrine](e3450.html), or about a 15 minute walk from the Miyajima ferry pier.
