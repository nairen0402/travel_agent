The Akashi Kaikyo Bridge (明石海峡大橋, Akashi Kaikyō Ōhashi) is, with a length of almost four kilometers, the world's longest suspension bridge. Opened in 1998, it spans the Akashi Strait (Akashi Kaikyo) between [Kobe](e2159.html) and Awaji Island and is part of the Kobe-Awaji-Naruto Expressway, one of three [expressways](e2354.html) that connect Honshu with [Shikoku](/list/e1107.html).

An interesting way to experience the bridge up close is walking the **Maiko Marine Promenade**, a circuit of observatory walkways under the bridge's platform, about 50 meters above the water. Accessed by elevator from the base of the bridge (Kobe side), the walkways offer unique views of the bridge's interior, the Akashi Strait and Osaka Bay.

The **Bridge Exhibition Center** at the foot of the Kobe side of the bridge provides well-presented information about the planning and construction of the bridge and about other suspension bridges around the world, although the details are available only in [Japanese](e621.html).

View from Maiko Marine Promenade

The Bridge Exhibition Center and the Maiko Marine Promenade are located a short walk from Maiko Station on the JR Sanyo Line (25 minutes, 320 yen from Sannomiya Station by local train) or Maiko-Koen Station on the Sanyo Railway Main Line.
