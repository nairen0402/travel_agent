Standing 131 meters tall just across from [Kyoto Station](e3922.html), Kyoto Tower (京都タワー) is [Kyoto](e2158.html)'s tallest structure and a rare modern iconic landmark in the city famous for its ancient [temples](e2058.html) and [shrines](e2059.html). The tower was completed in 1964, the same year as the opening of the [shinkansen](e2018.html) and the [Tokyo Olympics](e2260.html).

A viewing platform is located 100 meters above ground and affords a 360 degree view of [Kyoto](e2158.html) and as far as [Osaka](e2157.html) on clear days. Kyoto Tower stands on top of a typical commercial building, which contains souvenir shops, restaurants and a hotel. A [public bath](e2074.html) in the basement closed permanently in 2021.
