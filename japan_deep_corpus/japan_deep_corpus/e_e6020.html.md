Obuse (小布施) is a small town in northern [Nagano Prefecture](/list/e1216.html) with a pretty town center. [Hokusai](e6022.html), a renowned [Edo Period](e2128.html) (1603-1867) woodblock painter, who is best known for his [ukiyo-e](e2291.html) woodblock print, The Great Wave off Kanagawa, spent the later years of his life in Obuse with his patron and student, Takai Kozan, a wealthy local merchant and art enthusiast.

Several of the town's highlights are related to the artist and his patron, including the [Hokusai Museum](e6022.html), the [Takai Kozan Museum](e6023.html) and the painted ceiling of a [local temple](e6022.html). Obuse is also well known for its seasonal produce, especially the locally grown chestnuts.
