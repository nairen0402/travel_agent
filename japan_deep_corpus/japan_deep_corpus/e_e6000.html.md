Nagano City (長野) is the capital of [Nagano Prefecture](/list/e1216.html). It evolved as a temple town around [Zenkoji](e6001.html), one of Japan's most popular [temples](e2058.html). In 1998, the city hosted the [Winter Olympic Games](e6002.html), and some former [Olympic facilities](e6002.html) can still be viewed around town.

In the forested mountains northwest of the city center lies the Togakushi area which attracts tourists with its popular [shrines](e6005.html) and as the legendary home of the Togakure Ninja School. The [Togakushi Ninpo Museum](e6006.html) and the [Kids Ninja Village](e6007.html) provide good entertainment and a glimpse of the area's [ninja](e2295.html) past.
