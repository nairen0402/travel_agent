The Joetsu Shinkansen (上越新幹線, Jōetsu Shinkansen) is a [shinkansen](e2018.html) line that connects [Tokyo](e2164.html) with Niigata. It was opened in 1982 and is operated by the East Japan Railway Company, commonly known as JR East. It provides tourists with access to [hot spring](e2292.html) and [ski](e2262.html) resorts in [Gunma](/list/e1209.html) and [Niigata](/list/e1207.html) prefectures.

Two train categories operate on the Joetsu Shinkansen:

The **Toki** is the faster of the two train categories along the Joetsu Shinkansen. It runs between Tokyo and Niigata stations. Toki trains carry a Gran Class car, the first class service by JR East with 2x1 seats per row.

The **Tanigawa** is the slower of the two train categories along the Joetsu Shinkansen, serving all stations between Tokyo and Echigo-Yuzawa. It operates mainly during the morning and evening rush hours, targeting commuters from [Gunma](/list/e1209.html) and [Saitama](/list/e1213.html) prefectures. During the winter months, some trains serve Gala Yuzawa Station at the base of the [Gala Yuzawa ski resort](e7690.html).

Note: For simplification, some rare train compositions and stopping patterns are omitted.
