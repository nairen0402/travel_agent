Built in [Kotohira](e5450.html) in 1835, Kanamaruza Theater (金丸座) is Japan's oldest surviving, complete [kabuki](e2090.html) playhouse. From time to time, it still stages kabuki performances, featuring some of the country's most popular kabuki stars.

When no shows are held, the theater is open to visitors who can explore Kanamaruza's audience hall, stage, and dressing rooms. Be sure to check out the basement to see the workings of the human powered rotating stage and trapdoors used by actors to dramatically enter and exit performances.

Inside the theater

Kanamaruza is located about a 15-20 minute walk from JR Kotohira and Kotoden Kotohira stations, about 200 meters off the approach to [Kompirasan Shrine](e5451.html).
