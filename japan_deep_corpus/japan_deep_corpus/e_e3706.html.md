Otemon Square and the Former City Library

The Otemon Square (追手門広場, Ōtemon Hiroba), named after and standing across from the main entrance gate of [Hirosaki Castle](e3700.html), is designed as a stepping-off point for visitors to [Hirosaki](e3701.html). It has an extensive sightseeing information center where travelers can get maps, pamphlets and advice about the city's sightseeing spots.

There is also a souvenir shop, a few restaurants and a small exhibition about local handicrafts and the [Neputa Festival](e3704.html). Around Otemon Square stand a few of Hirosaki's early Western-style buildings, including the former city library, which was constructed in 1907. The library is no longer in use, but is open to the public.

Otemon Square is located just south of [Hirosaki Park](e3700.html) next to the city hall, a 15 minute [bus](e2015.html) ride west of JR Hirosaki Station by the [Dotemachi Loop Bus](e3702.html). Get off at Shiyakusho-mae bus stop.
