Local wine has been produced in [Furano](e6825.html) since 1972. Located on a hill overlooking the town, the Furano Winery (富良野ワイン工場, Furano Wine Kōjō) is open to the public and includes free wine tasting. Not far from the factory stands the Restaurant Winehouse where you can try the wines in combination with Western dishes.

About 1.5 kilometers north of the winery stands also the Grape Juice Factory (closed in 2025), where visitors can observe the production process from behind a window and try the tasty grape juice. A small [lavender field](e6826.html) is also located on the hill.

The winery and grape juice factory are a ten minute [car](e2024.html) or [taxi](e2021.html) ride north of central [Furano](e6825.html). Public transportation is unavailable.
