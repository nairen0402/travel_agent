The Hyogo Prefectural Museum of Art (兵庫県立美術館, Hyōgo Kenritsu Bijutsukan) is a modern and contemporary art museum found along the waterfront in the HAT Kobe district. It was built as part of the city's recovery efforts after the 1995 Great Hanshin Earthquake, and was designed by Ando Tadao, one of Japan's leading contemporary [architects](e2111_architects.html) who also designed [Omotesando Hills](e3006.html#hills) and museums on [Naoshima](e5475.html).

The museum is the largest of its kind in western Japan, and hosts exhibitions of paintings, prints, sculptures and other artwork by both foreign and Japanese artists. Its permanent exhibition displays a rotating collection of modern and contemporary art and features artists with strong ties to Hyogo Prefecture. The museum also has auditoriums and event space for live music and performing arts, as well as a restaurant, cafeteria and museum shop.

The Hyogo Prefectural Museum of Art is located in HAT Kobe, a relatively newly-developed city district east of the city center. It can be reached in a ten minute walk from Iwaya Station on the Hanshin Main Line (4 minutes, 160 yen from Sannomiya Station) or in a 15 minute walk from Nada Station on the JR Kobe Line (3 minutes, 140 yen from Sannomiya Station).

The Hyogo Prefectural Museum of Art is also just a few steps from the [Earthquake Museum](e3555.html).
