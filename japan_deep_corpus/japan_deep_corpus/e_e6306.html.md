The MOA Museum of Art (MOA美術館, MOA Bijutsukan) is spectacularly located on the slopes above [Atami](e6317.html) and exhibits an impressive collection of Japanese and East Asian art. The MOA Museum of Art was opened in 1982 by the Mokichi Okada Association (MOA). Okada Mokichi was an avid art collector who lived from 1882 to 1955 and also founded the [Hakone Museum of Art](e5211.html) in [Hakone](e5200.html).

Among the exhibits in MOA are three national treasures and numerous important cultural properties, including paintings, works of [calligraphy](e2095.html), sculptures and other crafts. The museum also features a [Japanese style garden](e2099.html) with [tea houses](e2096.html) and a [noh theater](e2091.html).

The MOA Museum of Art is located in [Atami](e6317.html) along the northeastern coast of the [Izu Peninsula](e6310.html).
