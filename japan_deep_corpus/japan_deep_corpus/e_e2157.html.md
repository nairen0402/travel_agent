Osaka (大阪, Ōsaka) is Japan's second largest metropolitan area after [Tokyo](e2164.html). It has been the economic powerhouse of the [Kansai Region](/list/e1105.html) for many centuries. Osaka was formerly known as Naniwa. Before the [Nara Period](e2132.html), when the capital used to be moved with the reign of each new [emperor](e2135.html), Naniwa was once Japan's capital city, the first one ever known.

In the 16th century, [Toyotomi Hideyoshi](e2123.html) chose Osaka as the location for his [castle](e4000.html), and the city may have become Japan's political capital if [Tokugawa Ieyasu](e2128.html) had not terminated the Toyotomi lineage after Hideyoshi's death and established his government in distant [Edo (Tokyo)](e2164.html).
