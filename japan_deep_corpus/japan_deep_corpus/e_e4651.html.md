Most visitors to [Yakushima](e4650.html), whether traveling by air or sea, will pass through [Kagoshima](e4600.html) (see [how to get to Kagoshima](e4604.html)). The only way to circumvent Kagoshima is by taking a direct flight from [Osaka](e2157.html) or [Fukuoka](e2161.html) to Yakushima.

High speed jetfoil boats operate daily between [Kagoshima](e4600.html) (high speed ferry terminal of Kagoshima Port) and [Yakushima](e4650.html) (Miyanoura or Anbo Port). Direct boats depart every 1-3 hours (fewer in winter). It is also possible to travel via neighboring Tanegashima Island. The one way ride takes 2-3 hours depending on stops and costs 12,700 yen. A round trip ticket costs 23,300 yen and must be used within seven days. Online reservations can be made through [Direct Ferries](https://www.directferries.com/?dfpid=2097&affid=9&rurl=tane_yaku_jetfoil.htm).

The cost for bringing an average sized car onto the ferry is about 26,500 yen one way.

There is one jetfoil per day between Miyanoura Port on Yakushima and [Ibusuki](e4677.html) on the [Satsuma Peninsula](e4675.html). The one way ride takes 75 minutes and costs 10,000 yen.

Above fees and schedules are subject to change. Be sure to check current yen [exchange rates](e2196.html).

[Yakushima](e4650.html) is developed all along its coast except in the west where the steep mountain slopes run all the way into the sea. A road [encircles the island](e4656.html) connecting the towns together, and the majority of Yakushima's [hotels](e2025.html), [beaches](e2461.html), hot springs, waterfalls and museums are within a short distance of it.

Yakushima's roads are easy to [drive](e2024.html) except for the one along the west coast as well as the ones that lead into the island's interior as they are narrow and winding. The cedar forests are located in the mountainous interior and are accessed by a few roads from the larger towns, such as Miyanoura and Anbo, which lead to the various hiking trails and nature parks.

#### Getting around by car

The most convenient way to get around Yakushima is by [rental car](e2024.html). Rental car outlets are located at Miyanoura Port and at the airport. A car is the only way to access some of the trailheads and to circle the entire island, because buses do not operate along the narrow road along the western coast. It takes about three hours to circle the island by car. Note, that the [Arakawa trailhead](e4653.html) cannot be access by car (except in winter). Use a [shuttle bus](e4653.html) instead.

#### Getting around by bus

Most [buses](e2015.html) on Yakushima are operated by Tanegashima-Yakushima Kotsu. They run about once per hour along Yakushima's coast except along the west coast (between Nagata and Okonotaki). Buses into the interior are less frequent: there are lines from Miyanoura Port to [Shiratani Unsuikyo](e4654.html) and from Anbo Town to [Yakusugi Land](e4655.html) and the Kigensugi. From March to November, [access to the Arakawa trailhead](e4653.html) is provided by shuttle buses from the Yakusugi Museum (also known as Yakusugi Shizenkan).

1-day, 3-day and 4-day bus passes are available for 2000, 3000 and 4000 yen respectively; however, they are they are not valid on the shuttle buses.
