Fukiya (吹屋) is a remote rural district in the hills of [Takahashi City](e5775.html), about 15 kilometers west of the city center, with a picturesque [preserved town](e2422.html). The town developed and prospered around a copper mine and also produced bengara color pigment from red iron oxide. Its fortunes declined when the copper mine closed and the demand for bengara dwindled by the 1920s.

Bengara can still be seen on many of the district's houses for decoration purposes and to protect the wood from water and fire. Bengara was also used for dyeing clothes, for [paintings](e2291.html) and for waterproofing ships. Below are the main attractions found around Fukiya today. A combination ticket is available for 1000 yen that includes entry to all the attractions.

  Fukiya Furusato Village

  Hours: Varies by shop; typically from 9:00 to 17:00  
  Closed: Varies by shop

  The only large collection of houses in the area, this village used to be a bustling town thanks to the copper mine. Today, it consists of a single road lined with red-roofed houses and bengara walls. Some of the houses remain private dwellings, while others have been converted into restaurants and shops. Walking through the street is almost like going back in time.

  Located about a kilometer south of the Fukiya Village, the Bengara Factory Museum is made up of multiple restored buildings from the [Meiji Period](e2130.html) (1868-1912), exhibiting how bengara was manufactured back in the day. In the process, the minerals are first baked at a very high temperature before being rinsed and sifted in order to remove impurities and finally dried into slabs.

  Also located about a kilometer south of the Fukiya Village, the Sasaune Mine is one of the shafts of the former copper mine and is open to the public. The shaft stays at a cool 15 degrees Celsius all year around, and there are mannequins that give visitors an idea of how copper and melanterite, the raw material to produce the red iron oxide, was mined. The shaft is relatively long before opening up to a large chamber which leads to several other shafts.

  Hirokane Residence

  Hours: 10:00 to 17:00 (until 16:00 from December to March)  
  Closed: December 29-31  
  Admission: 400 yen  
  Typical visit duration: 20-30 minutes

  Located 3.5 kilometers south of the Fukiya Village, the Hirokane Residence resembles a castle on the hill with its stone walls and two-story main gate. The Hirokane family were wealthy merchants who operated the nearby copper mine and manufactured bengara. The residence is large and includes several warehouses, a tearoom, a garden as well as entertaining space. Visitors can view most of the rooms only from the outside.

Three buses per day connect Bitchu-Takahashi Station to Fukiya Village (60 minutes, 800 yen one way). The mines and bengara museum are about one kilometer or a 20 minute walk south of the village, but the Hirokane residence is located about four kilometers away. As a result, a [rental car](e2024.html) is the recommended means to explore the Fukiya District. Rental car outlets can be found in [Okayama](e5700.html), a 90 minute drive away.
