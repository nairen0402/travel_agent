Limited express trains (特急, tokkyū, lit. "special express") are the fastest [trains](e2016.html#category) in Japan after the [shinkansen](e2018.html) (bullet trains). With a few exceptions, they travel over long distances between different cities or regions and serve only major stations along their way.

Because of their greater speed, travelers have to pay a supplement fee (limited express fee) to ride most of them. But unlike the shinkansen, limited express trains share the railway tracks with slower [train categories](e2016.html#category), such as local and rapid trains.

Limited express trains typically offer reclinable, forward-facing seats, which often feature a table and - in case of newer train sets - power outlets. Multiple [toilets](e2003.html) are found on board.

### Which railway companies operate limited express trains?

Several [train companies](e2019.html) in Japan operate limited express trains. In particular, the [JR](e2019.html) companies are operating a large number of limited express trains across Japan (see [map below](#jr)), especially between major stations and cities not connected to the [shinkansen](e2018.html) network.

Among non-JR companies, quite a few operate limited express trains, but only a handful charge a limited express fee like JR, while the other companies do not require a surcharge for riding their limited express trains, which tend to be suburban rather than interregional. See the [map below](#nonjr) to see a list of non-JR limited express trains.

### Tickets

In order to ride most limited express trains, you need to pay a **limited express fee** (also known as supplement fee or express fee) in addition to the **base fare**. Both are calculated on the distance traveled. For example, the base fare from Shinjuku to Matsumoto is 4070 yen and the limited express fee is 2550 yen based on the 225 kilometers traveled.

#### How to pay the base fare

The base fare can be paid with a paper ticket or - in some cases - with an IC card:

Base fare **paper tickets** can [be purchased](e2016.html) at ticket offices or ticket machines, or online and picked up at a ticket machine before use.

If your departure and arrival stations are located within the same [IC card](e2359_003.html) area, you can pay the base fare with an **IC card**, such as [Suica or Icoca](e2359_003.html), by tapping the card at the ticket gates. However, the use of IC cards is not possible if the arrival or departure station is located outside the area covered by IC cards or the stations are located in separate IC card areas (e.g. one in the Suica and one in the Icoca area). A paper ticket is required in such cases. Depending on the route, a paper ticket may also be required for journeys of more than 200 kilometers.

#### How to pay the limited express fee

The limited express fee can be paid with a paper ticket or - for some trains - with an e-ticket:

Limited express fee **paper tickets** can be purchased at ticket offices or ticket machines, or online and picked up at a ticket machine before use. Most people buy the base fare and limited express fee tickets at the same time, but you can also purchase them separately.

For a small number of JR trains (mainly around Tokyo) and for many non-JR trains, it is possible to purchase the limited express fee as **paperless e-tickets** without the need to pick up a physical ticket. If you use an e-ticket, keep your confirmation screen or email ready to find your seat or to show it to a conductor if asked for it. Note that conductors do not usually check tickets unless you sit on a reserved seat that is not supposed to be occupied. But there are exceptions. Our [list of trains below](#hokkaido) indicates for which trains e-tickets are available.

#### Can I pay the limited express fee on board of the train? The limited express fee should generally be purchased before boarding the train. On some trains it can be purchased on board from the conductor; however, the fee may be higher and you may not be able to sit. In rare cases, you may be asked to get off. Are there any limited express trains that don't require a supplement fee? Yes, there are several suburban railway companies, including Keio, Tokyu, Keikyu, Hanshin, Hankyu, Keihan and Nishitetsu, which operate "limited express" trains but do not charge a limited express fee. They tend to be suburban trains and are not the main subject of this page. Keikyu is one of the railway companies whose limited express trains do not require a supplement Seat reservationsAre seat reservations required? Many limited express trains require a seat reservation, while others also offer unreserved seating (see the [list below](#hokkaido) for details on each train). Green car (business class) seating or premium seats are also available on many limited express trains and almost always require a reservation. The number of all-reserved trains has been on the increase in recent years, and the trend is expected to continue. How do I make a seat reservation? The seat reservation is made at the time the limited express ticket is purchased, which - [as covered above](#buy_ltd) - can be done at a ticket office, ticket machine or online. Note that if you have a rail pass that covers limited express trains, [the seat reservation process](#pass) is a bit different. Seat reservations can be made from one month before the travel date. How much do seat reservations cost? The fee for seat reservations is included in the limited express fee. The limited express fee for reserved seats is a few hundred yen higher than the limited express fee for unreserved seats. The difference is typically 530 yen, but on many trains, there are seasonal variations, with the difference ranging between 330 and 930 yen, while on other trains the fee remains the same year round (see the [list below](#hokkaido) for details on each train). What if a train is fully booked and does not carry unreserved seats? Trains that carry unreserved seating cannot sell out, because passengers can always board and use the unreserved cars without booking a seat. But what happens if an all-reserved train is fully booked? On many limited express trains without unreserved seating, it is possible to purchase a standing ticket when all seats are sold out. These tickets can be bought at ticket offices and machines and allow passengers to stand in the ordinary cars, but not in the Green Cars. On selected limited express trains in the [Tokyo](e2164.html) and [Hokkaido](/list/e1101.html) regions, it is also possible to ride an all-reserved train with a "limited express ticket without seat assignment" or with a [rail pass](e2357.html) that covers the specific train. In this case, you may sit in any unoccupied seat; however, if another passenger with a reservation for that seat arrives, you must vacate the seat. If no vacant seats are available, you can stand in the ordinary cars, but not in the Green Cars. Typical interior of a limited express train What if I have a rail pass? Many [rail passes](e2357.html), including the [Japan Rail Pass](e2361.html) and many regional JR passes, fully cover limited express trains. If your pass does, you can use unreserved seats on limited express trains simply with your pass, with no additional steps required. However, if you wish to use a reserved seat, you must make a seat reservation before boarding, which is free with many passes. How to make seat reservations with a rail pass that covers limited express trains? Seat reservations can be made at ticket offices or ticket machines. Online reservations are possible only in some situations and still require pass holders to pick up physical tickets at a ticket machine or office before their journey. These situations include the following: * **JR East Reservations website**: Online seat reservations for selected limited express trains in eastern Japan are possible for pass holders of the Japan Rail Pass and several regional JR passes via the [JR East Reservations](https://www.eki-net.com/en/jreast-train-reservation/Top/Index) website. * **Official Japan Rail Pass website**: If you purchase your pass via the [official Japan Rail Pass website](https://japanrailpass.net/en/) (as opposed to other sales channels), you can use a dedicated website for making online seat reservations. * **Official JR West website**: Likewise, if you purchase a regional rail pass for western Japan via the [official JR West website](https://www.westjr.co.jp/travel-information/en/tickets-passes/jrwest-rail-pass/) (as opposed to other sales channels), you can use a dedicated website for making online seat reservations. * **JR Kyushu Rail Pass Online Booking**: Online seat reservations for [Kyushu Rail Pass](e2361_05.html) holders are possible if the pass is purchased through the [official Kyushu Rail Pass website](https://www.jrkyushu.co.jp/english/railpass/) or other selected sales channels; however, there is a fee of 1000 yen per reservation! Do all rail passes cover limited express trains? No, there are many [rail passes](e2357.html) that cover only the base fare and do not cover the limited express fee, including the [Hakone Free Pass](e2358_008.html), the [Nikko Pass](e2358_002.html), the [Kintetsu Rail Pass](e2357_006.html) and the [Seishun 18 Kippu](e2362.html). If you wish to ride a limited express with such a pass, you must [purchase the limited express fee](#buy_ltd) separately at a ticket office or machine or online, if available. On board of the Narita Express List of JR limited express trains [Japan Railways (JR)](e2019.html) offer particularly many limited express trains, which tend to serve major cities not yet connected to the [shinkansen](e2018.html) network.

For technical reasons, we did not include in the above list the Keisei Skyliner, which connects [Tokyo](e2164.html)'s Ueno and Nippori stations with [Narita Airport](e2027.html) (because it is a special type of limited express), and the all-reserved Meitetsu airport trains, which connect [Nagoya](e2155.html) with [Central Japan Airport](e2431.html) (because they require a premium seat fee rather than a limited express fee).
