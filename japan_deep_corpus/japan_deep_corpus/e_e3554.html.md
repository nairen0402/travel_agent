[Tokyo](e2164.html) and [Kobe](e2159.html) are connected with each other by the JR [Tokaido/Sanyo Shinkansen](e2018.html). Nozomi trains require about 160 minutes to reach Shin-Kobe Station from [Tokyo](e2164.html), while direct Hikari trains require roughly 195 minutes. The regular one way fare from Tokyo to Shin-Kobe is 14,420 yen for a non-reserved seat or around 15,000 yen for a reserved seat. The [Japan Rail Pass](e2361.html) is valid on Hikari trains, but a supplement needs to be paid on Nozomi trains.

The one way trip from Tokyo to Kobe by [overnight bus](e2366.html) takes about 8-9 hours. The competition between bus companies on the Tokyo - Osaka - Kobe route is fierce and has produced various [discount offers](e2366.html). Fares by discount bus operators, such as [Willer Express](https://willerexpress.com/en/bus_search/tokyo/all/hyogo/kobe/?utm_source=web&utm_medium=ad&utm_campaign=af01&aid=184), start from around 5000 yen. Buses on this price level are usually standard buses, which offer little comfort. The one way trip on more comfortable buses costs around 8500 yen. Online Reservations can be made through [Willer](https://willer-travel.com/en/bus_search/tokyo/all/hyogo/kobe/?utm_source=web&utm_medium=ad&utm_campaign=af01&aid=184) and [Japan Bus Online](https://japanbusonline.com/en/CourseSearch/11700010073?afcd=MDI=&RosenNm=tokyo-kobe).
