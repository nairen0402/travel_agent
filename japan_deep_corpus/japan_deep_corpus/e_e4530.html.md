Yunoko Onsen and Yunoko Island

Yunoko Onsen (湯の児温泉) is a [hot spring](e2292.html) resort along the scenic sea coast north of central [Minamata](e4525.html), still located within the municipal limits of Minamata City.

Several of the resort's [ryokan](e2029.html) offer rooms and baths with panoramic views over the sea. Some of them also open their baths to day-trippers for an admission fee of typically 300 to 800 yen.

Just off the coast, connected with the mainland by a bridge is Yunoko Island, a small island with walking paths and a small [shrine](e2059.html) on its summit. A walk around the island is particularly memorable after dark during high tide, when waves and insects can make for an Indiana Jones like adventure.

Yunoko Onsen can be reached in a 20-25 minute [bus](e2015.html) or [car](e2024.html) ride from Minamata Station. The one way bus fare is 150 yen, and there is a bus only every 2-4 hours.
