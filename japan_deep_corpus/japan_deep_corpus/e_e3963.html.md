Restaurants in Pontocho

As Japan's former capital and seat of the imperial court for over a millennium, [Kyoto](e2158.html) offers a rich culinary tradition. The local food culture is diverse and ranges from aristocratic [kaiseki](e2348.html) course dinners to vegetarian shojin ryori of [monks](e2058.html) and the simple obanzai home-style cooking.

While some restaurants look to the past for inspiration, others experiment with new flavors. Fusion restaurants, which combine ingredients and techniques of Kyoto cuisine with cooking styles from other parts of the world, can also be found in the city. The [Pontocho](e3921.html) nightlife district is one of the best places to find good fusion restaurants alongside traditional establishments. Not far away, the [Gion](e3902.html) district also offers a wide range of interesting dining opportunities, as does the [Kyoto Station](e3922.html) area.

Regular Japanese food that is not necessarily associated with Kyoto in particular, such as [ramen](e2042.html), [sushi](e2038.html) and [udon](/r/e105.html), is also available across the city. Food fans should not miss a visit to the [Nishiki Market](e3931.html) in [central Kyoto](e2158_central.html), which has been serving the city for many centuries.

### Kaiseki Ryori

[Kaiseki ryori](e2348.html) has its origin in the [tea ceremony](e2096.html), but later evolved into an elaborate dining style popular among aristocratic circles. Kyoto-style kaiseki ryori (kyo kaiseki) is particularly refined, placing an emphasis on subtle flavors and local, seasonal ingredients. A kaiseki meal has a prescribed [order of courses](e2348.html) which is determined by the cooking method of each dish.

One way for travelers to enjoy kaiseki is staying at a [ryokan](e2029.html) where a kaiseki dinner is included with the stay. But kaiseki meals can also be enjoyed at restaurants, including high-end **ryotei**, many of which can be found in the [Pontocho](e3921.html) and [Gion](e3902.html) districts. A good kaiseki meal usually costs around 10,000 yen per person, but prices can go as high as 30,000 yen or as low as 6,000 yen. Some restaurants depart from tradition and include elements of foreign cuisines.

### Shojin Ryori

Whereas kaiseki developed out of the affluence of the aristocrats, shojin ryori developed from the austerity of [Buddhist](e2055.html) monks. Prohibited from taking the life of other living creatures, Buddhist monks had to make do without meat or fish in their diet. Consisting of strictly vegetarian dishes, shojin ryori can nonetheless be savory and filling. Travelers who spend the night at a [temple lodging](e2025_temple_lodgings.html) will be able to enjoy a meal as part of the stay.

A common ingredient in shojin ryori is [tofu](e2045_tofu.html), which is a local specialty of Kyoto. The preparation of tofu is so common that it can also be referred to as **Tofu Ryori** ("tofu cuisine"). One popular dish that is widely served at tofu restaurants in Kyoto is **Yudofu**, soft tofu simmered with vegetables in broth. A meal of Yudofu usually costs 1500 to 2000 yen, but the price can be higher or lower depending on the quality of the restaurant. The [Nanzenji](e3905.html) and [Arashiyama](e3912.html) districts are particularly famous for tofu cuisine.

### Obanzai Ryori

Obanzai Ryori is the traditional home-style cooking of Kyoto. It is made up of multiple small dishes that are usually quite simple to prepare. Local produce that is in season is best suited for the dishes. Although the cooking methods are usually not complicated, obanzai dishes can be made very rich by chefs skillfully bringing out the natural flavors of the ingredients.

Restaurants that serve obanzai ryori can be found all over Kyoto. Many of them have a relaxed and friendly atmosphere that reflects the home style of cooking. A full meal usually costs 2000 to 3000 yen, but can vary depending on the number and type of dishes ordered.

### Kawayuka/Kawadoko

Kawayuka, or Kawadoko as it is known outside of central Kyoto, is the summer pasttime of dining outdoors on temporary platforms built over flowing water. Developed as a way to beat the summer heat, kawayuka is a great way to experience Kyoto cuisine while taking in the cooling effects of the flowing water and lively summer atmosphere.

The most famous area to experience kawayuka is along the Kamogawa River in central Kyoto, especially around [Pontocho](e3921.html). From May to September, restaurants here construct temporary wooden decks over the canal on the river's west bank. Many places serve [kaiseki meals](e2348.html), however other types of cuisine are also available.

[Kibune](e3967.html) and [Takao](e3940.html) in the forested mountains north of central Kyoto, are also popular places to try kawayuka, although here it is called kawadoko. In [Kibune](e3967.html) especially, the platforms are built just centimeters above the river and provide almost complete relief from the summer heat.

Terrace dining is popular, especially along Kamogawa River in the evenings on weekends and during holidays, when advance reservations are a must at most river-facing restaurants along [Pontocho](e3921.html) (usually in Japanese by phone).
