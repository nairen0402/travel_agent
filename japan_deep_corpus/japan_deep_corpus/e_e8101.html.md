Covered by: [Japan Rail Pass](/e/e2361.html)(2150 yen supplement required)

Take the [Tokaido Shinkansen](e2018_tokaido.html) from [Tokyo](e2164.html) to Shin-Osaka or Himeji Station and transfer to the Super Hakuto [limited express](e2016.html#category) train to [Tottori](e8100.html). The one way trip takes around 6 hours, costs about 20,000 yen and is not fully covered by the [Japan Rail Pass](e2361.html), because the Super Hakuto limited express train partially [runs on non-JR tracks](e2368.html) and costs a 2150 yen supplement fee. Note that seat reservations are mandatory on the Super Hakuto.

Above fees and schedules are subject to change. Be sure to check current yen [exchange rates](e2196.html).

The [Tottori Sand Dunes](e8102.html), the city's main attraction, lie outside the city center and are accessible by [bus](e2015.html) from Tottori Station. Most other of [Tottori](e8100.html)'s attractions are found on the northeast side of Tottori Station in the city center and can be reached in short bus rides or on foot in about half an hour from the station.

Besides a network of [regular city buses](e2015.html), there are two loop buses useful for tourists:

The **100 yen Kururi Buses** operate everyday of the year along three lines to sightseeing spots around the city center, including the [castle ruins](e8103.html) and [Kannon-in Temple](e8104.html) (but not the [sand dunes](e8102.html)). Buses depart every twenty minutes and cost 100 yen per ride.

The **Kirin Jishi Loop Bus** operates only on weekends and [holidays](e2062.html), connecting Tottori Station with the [castle ruins](e8103.html), the [sand dunes](e8102.html) and Tottori Port in a counter-clockwise loop. The fare is 300 yen per ride or 600 yen for a day pass. There are 1-2 buses per hour.
