Origami (折り紙) is the art of folding paper into different shapes without using glue or scissors. Common folding objects include animals, flowers, balloons and planes.

The most popular object is the crane, a symbol of longevity. It is said that folding 1000 cranes can make a wish come true. Therefore, 1000 cranes are customarily given to sick people to wish them a fast recovery. In addition, cranes are a symbol of peace. As such, large number of folded cranes are laid down beside the monuments that remember the atomic bombs in the peace parks of [Hiroshima](e2160.html) and [Nagasaki](e2162.html).
