Construction Notice:

The Uchikoza Theater is closed for [renovations](/event/construction.html) from September 2024 for approximately four years, i.e. until around autumn 2028.

Uchiko-za (内子座) is a fully operational [kabuki theater](e2090.html) in the center of town and a distinguishing feature and point of pride of [Uchiko](e5550.html). The beautiful, multi-story building was built in 1916 and continues to occasionally host events, including [kabuki](e2090.html) and [bunraku](e2092.html) performances.

Visitors can enter Uchiko-za and explore the many trap doors and hidden passageways around the stage. [Kabuki](e2090.html) stages are known for their elaborate design, allowing for sudden disappearances, dramatic entrances and the like. At Uchiko-za, visitors have the opportunity to examine the mechanics of such stage choreography.

Uchiko-za is located a 5-10 minute walk from JR Uchiko Station.
