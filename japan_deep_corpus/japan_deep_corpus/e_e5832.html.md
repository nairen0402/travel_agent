Construction Notice:

The Former Taisha Station is closed due to [renovations](/event/construction.html) until around mid April 2026.

The Former Taisha Station (旧大社駅, Kyū Taisha Eki) is the retired terminal station of the now-defunct JR Taisha Line. Opened in 1912 and served until 1990, the line was once the main entry way to [Izumo Taisha Shrine](e5804.html). While the former line's railway tracks and other stations have since vanished, Taisha Station has been preserved as a museum.

The station building was constructed in 1924 and stands as a beautifully preserved example of Imperial Crown-style architecture. The style, which borrows elements of traditional [Japanese architecture](e2111.html), appeared in the 1920s and 30s when major public buildings were required to show a distinctively Japanese style in their design. The station building with its prominent use of wood and traditionally curved, tiled roofs, topped by ridgepole ornaments, is a striking example of this nationalistic expression.

Inside the station building, mannequins dressed in railway uniforms are placed beside old ticket machines, photographs and other historical equipment, while a preserved steam locomotive rests outside on a few of the remaining rails. The station was designated an Important Cultural Property in 2004 and is one of only three train stations from the [Taisho Period](e2129.html) to receive this distinction (the others are [Tokyo Station](e3037.html) and [Mojiko Station](e4878.html)).

The interior of the station

The Former Taisha Station is a 10-15 minute walk south of Izumo Taisha-mae Station or about a 15-20 minute walk south of [Izumo Taisha](e5804.html).
